INFORMATION SEARCH WITH MOBILE TOURIST GUIDES:
A SURVEY OF USAGE INTENTION

JÖRG RASINGER, MATTHIAS FUCHS, and WOLFRAM HÖPKEN
ECCA-eTourism Competence Center Austria, Innsbruck, Austria

As mobile tourist guides show huge potentials to support tourists’ information search, executives
need to know which mobile systems characterized by which specific functionalities should be
provided. This article proposes an empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative methods to deduce both product definition and product marketing information related to mobile tourist
guides. First, a methodology mix combining qualitative (i.e., explorative survey, focus group interviews) and quantitative techniques (i.e., pilot study, expert interviews) responds to the question
“Which services should be developed?” Secondly, again in the preprototype phase and based on
survey data, ideal functionality compositions for promising tourist guides are deduced with regression analysis. Finally, based on technology acceptance theory customer prejudices towards mobile
tourist guides are identified. The obtained results support the hypotheses, indicating strong performance expectations and pronounced effort expectancies towards the deduced concepts designed to
support information search by means of mobile tourist guides.

Introduction

site tourist information centers. Mobile information services, due to their ubiquitous nature, may
overcome many of the shortcomings of traditional
stationary Internet services. Mobile guides entail
high usage opportunities to support tourists’ information search. Benefits from ubiquity on which
tourists may capitalize stem from spatial, temporal, and contextual mobility, respectively (Fuchs
& Höpken, in press). Put differently, tourists may
be in touch with the destination-specific information network and be reached at any place and any
time using their personal portable devices (e.g.,

The Internet has grown to be the number one
source for acquiring information for travel purposes in the pretrip phase (Bieger & Laesser,
2004a). Thus, much effort has been spent in investigating the “does and don’ts” of tourism websites. However, in the on-site phase Internet services have by far not reached their full potential
(A.T. Kearney, 2004). Possible reasons are a lack
of destination infrastructure or simply the fact that
there are less demanding alternatives, such as on-

mobile, smart-phone). Thus, travel and tourism is
defined as a highly attractive and rewarding application field for mobile information services (Accenture, 2001).
Nevertheless, many examples of recently failed
pilot projects concerning mobile guides in tourism
exist (Pugh, Jupp, & Collomb, 2004; Rasinger,
Fuchs, Höpken, & Tuta, 2006). Due to enormous
investments in both mobile technologies and frequency-band licenses, providers of mobile services were heavily forced to implement services
in the market as fast as possible (Muthaiyah,
2004). In doing so, less demanded and immature
services were introduced (Forge, 2004). As a consequence, at the demand side the image of mobile
services was seriously damaged (Accenture, 2001).
Today, however, not only investors (e.g., mobile
phone operators), product developers, product
managers, and marketers (UMTS Forum, 2005)
but also destination managers (Höpken et al.,
2006) have the strong need for answers concerning the question “Which mobile services featuring
which functionalities should be offered to a specific tourist target group?” in order to optimally
support tourists’ information search needs. In addition, even though the right product configuration
can be identified (and subsequently developed), a
big marketing challenge remains with respect to
existing prejudices towards mobile services among
targeted users. Based on these specific managerial
requirements this article proposes and empirically
tests an approach combining qualitative and quantitative methods to deduce both product definition
and product marketing information related to mobile information services in tourism.
First, based on tourism literature (Bieger &
Laesser, 2004a; Chen & Gursoy, 2000; Fodness &
Murray, 1997, 1998, 1999; Murphy & Schegg,
2006; Snepenger, Meged, Snelling, & Kelly, 1990;
Staab & Werthner, 2002) and information search
theory (Atkin, 1973; Raitz & Dakhil, 1989; Schul
& Crompton, 1983), a qualitative and pilot studybased methodology mix was employed to systematically approach the research question “Which
mobile services should be developed?” Second,
based on mobile systems literature (Berger, Lehmann, & Lehner, 2003; Hinze & Voisard, 2003;
Schwinger, Grün, Pröll, Retschitzegger, & Schauerhuber, 2005; Wohltorf, Cissée, & Rieger, 2005),

promising future functionalities for mobile services applied in tourism were qualitatively deduced. Third, after the development of appropriate
research models the question “Which functionality
compositions should be envisioned for specific
mobile services?” was answered through regressive methods. Finally, again in the preprototype
phase and based on technology acceptance literature (Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989; Davis &
Venkatesh, 2004; Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &
Davis, 2003; Venkatesh, Ramesh, & Massey,
2003) and domain-specific innovativeness theory
(Goldsmith & Hofacker, 1991), a marketing-related
diagnosis of existing “prejudices towards promising mobile information services in tourism” was
undertaken in order to optimize product-related
communication with the end user. Figure 1 summarizes the structure of the presented research approach.
Preliminary Research
Qualitative Explorative Study
Existing literature distinguishes between external and internal information sources (Raitz & Dakhil, 1989; Schul & Crompton, 1983). Accordingly,
information search may take place, and almost always does initially, internally, such as when past
experiences are used as the basis for planning a
repeat visit to a destination (Fodness & Murray,
1997). Internal sources include personal experience, either with the specific destination or with
similar destinations. However, if the contents of
memory are not sufficient for decision making,
search activities extend out into the external environment. In the case of vacation travel, information
search is often predominantly external, involving
considerable effort and a variety of information
sources (Raitz & Dakhil, 1989). During their onsite phase, tourists usually satisfy their information needs by posing specific questions at particular points of information. Thus, in a very first
methodological step, interviews with representatives of various information points in a prominent
alpine tourism destination gave first insights into
the information requirements as typically articulated by tourists. By consulting both tourism and
information search literature (Bieger & Laesser,
2004b; Chen & Gursoy, 2000; Fodness & Murray,

Figure 1. Research approach.

1997, 1998, 1999; Murphy & Schegg, 2006; Snepenger et al., 1990), the following list of on-site
information sources emerged: auto club, conventions & visitors bureau, tourist office, highway information point, hotel concierge, guide book &
magazine, Internet, train & rail service, station
agent, state travel guide, tour company & travel
agent, TV/radio, airline & airport, taxi driver, gas
station, and kiosk.
A total of 16 interviews with representatives of
the mentioned information points were conducted
in the capital city of Tyrol (Austria) during September 2005 in order to record typical information
requirements most often articulated by tourists.
The following information typology distinguishing
between “archetypical” information needs was used
to structure the obtained answers: hedonic information (Dhar & Wertenbroch, 2000), surveillance
information (i.e., satisfies the need to understand
the environment relevant for well-being), guidance
information (i.e., satisfies the need to know which
alternative is best), performance information (i.e.,

satisfies the need to know how to behave to get
the highest possible performance from a chosen
alternative), and reinforcement information (e.g.,
satisfies the need to boost one’s confidence) (Atkin, 1973; Rasinger et al., 2006). Finally, a total
of 290 information requirements typically stated
by tourists were gathered and subsequently mapped
according to the corresponding information need
(Raffée & Silberer, 1981). In doing so, a total of
12 differing information services adequate to support tourists during their stay emerged, namely:
(1) transport information, (2) accommodation information, (3) security information, (4) event information, (5) information on wellness offers, (6)
gastronomy/nightlife information, (7) information
on sights (8) information on hiking and skiing
tours, (9) car rental information, (10) information
about currency & money exchange, (11) sports information, and (12) information on day-trips. Although these findings support the categories described in Pröll and Palkoska (2002), existing
research has so far not identified how information

support should be realized by means of mobile devices. Therefore, in a next step, literature from the
mobile information systems field was consulted to
deduce promising functionalities for electronic
tourist guides.
Mobile information systems comprising services for the tourism domain are often referred to
as mobile tourist guides (Höpken et al., 2006;
Schwinger et al., 2005). In academia as well as in
the industry, many initiatives for developing such
systems took place. For instance, a total of 14
projects with a specific focus on the on-site phase
have been identified by the POSITION team
(Murphy & Schegg, 2006; Pugh et al., 2004).
Many differing services are offered by these systems, such as location-based tour guides (Anegg,
Kunczier, Michlmayr, & Pospischil, 2002; Hinze
& Voisard, 2003), interactive route planners (Wohltorf et al., 2005), access on local event, nightlife,
restaurant, shopping, and sightseeing information,
to name a few (Berger et al., 2003). A prominent
recent project is etPlanner (Höpken et al., 2006), a
mobile information system for tourists, supporting
recommendation, adaptation, and personalization
functionalities on a wide variety of content, including event, accommodation, gastronomy, weather, and
transportation information, respectively. The project also promotes adaptation of the mobile device
(i.e., multimodality), content (i.e., multilinguality,
user-based content adaptation), and process.
At a very general level, Hess et al. (2005) classifies mobile information services by means of a
generic service market process model. Similarly,
one can differentiate for the tourism domain between mobile information services that support a
specific market transaction phase, such as information, agreement, settlement and after sales
(Rayport & Sviokla, 1996), and those information
services being defined as final service products
having clear economic values and prices (Hess et
al., 2005). For the empirical evaluation purpose
presented below, the focus lies on mobile information services supporting market transactions. Furthermore, literature suggests the coverage of information requirements along the phases of the
tourist life cycle, namely, the pretrip, the on-site,
and the after trip phase, respectively (Werthner &
Ricci, 2004). The focus of the below discussion
clearly is on mobile information services support-

ing the on-site phase. The following taxonomy intends to classify promising functionalities of mobile information services for the tourism domain.
In detail, they comprise search and browse functionalities providing user-triggered search processes for retrieving content explicitly initiated by
the (e.g., mobile) user. The basic methods are
“keyword search on structured data” and “directory-based browsing” (e.g., Sights > Churches >
St. Paul’s Cathedral). The push functionality automatically delivers information to the user (i.e.,
tourist) without explicit requests (Staab & Werthner, 2002). The information push is mainly triggered by contextual events, such as changes in the
user’s location or opening times of attractions
(Beer, Fuchs, Höpken, Rasinger, & Werthner,
2007). Recommendation functionalities satisfy the
individual information need to know which alternative is best according to a specific purpose (i.e.,
recommending those tourism products that are
most relevant to tourists by taking into account
their specific tour history). Furthermore, mCommerce
functionalities allow users to initiate transactional
processes, such as reservation, booking, or ticketing (Barnes, 2002). Finally, the feedback functionality enables users to share tourism experiences
and to annotate objects of interests with comments
and/or evaluative ratings (UMTS Forum, 2005).
The answers gathered from the qualitative explorative survey were in a last step related to the stated
functionalities. For instance, the need for surveillance information can typically be covered best by
search & browse functionalities. Additionally context-aware pull (e.g., recommendation) and push
functionalities may satisfy this specific information need (Staab & Werthner, 2002). Table 1 summarizes the coverage of “archetypical” tourist information needs through specific functionalities of
mobile information services (UMTS Forum,
2005). It should only be interpreted as a suggestion for the most plausible relationships between
tourists’ information needs and the corresponding
(i.e., most convincing) functionalities of mobile
information services.

porting on-site information search, focus group interviews (Krueger, 1998) were conducted in the
fall of 2005 with a total of 17 individuals from
different European countries (Italy, Germany, and
Austria). The opening question was: “Imagine getting a mobile device from your hotel in order to
support your destination stay. Which information
would be of main interest to you?” Interestingly,
relatively strong skepticism towards mobile information services became apparent. The main barriers and limitations identified in the literature (Accenture, 2001; BC Group, 2000), such as display
size, bandwidth, I/O interface, stability, durability,
connection quality, and costs, were immediately
emphasized. Nevertheless, the participants also
came up with promising ideas. A first suggestion
was a navigation system designed as a mobile version of GoogleEarth, allowing to freely search and
browse the virtual space to obtain information
about streets, restaurants, sights, shopping possibilities, points of interest, buildings, and public exhibitions. Furthermore, a mobile tourist guide
should calculate routes not only for car usage but
in particular also support exploration of destinations by foot. Secondly, an emergency service
helping users to get assistance in case of accidents
(e.g., car), traffic jams, or natural disasters was
proposed. Furthermore, participants of the focus
group came up with the idea of searching, booking, and buying tickets for events for a specific
genre at a specific time period. Furthermore, a mobile platform supporting full access to the shopping possibilities of a tourism destination was emphasized. Finally, a mobile search and browse
service was discussed that should offer fast Internet access to ensure the searchability of typical
Internet information such as weather, dictionaries,

local news, news from the home country, and
phone numbers.
The findings from the qualitative studies were
translated into a list comprising a total of 15 mobile information services to be used by tourists
during destination stay. Due to size restrictions
only a selection of six mobile information services
is described in greater detail below (Table 2).
Pilot Study
Next, the obtained 15 mobile information services were abstractly described by their functionalities, costs, and usability potentials and were
then evaluated by tourists by means of a quantitative pilot survey (N = 100) in Tyrol (Austria) in
the fall of 2005. Evaluation of usage propensity
was performed based on a self-administrated questionnaire using 6-point Likert scales (1 = very unlikely to 6 = very likely). The sample was composed as follows. Forty-seven percent of respondents
were female. The respondents were to a large part
younger than 30 years (63%); 23% were between
30 and 40 years old while 14% were 40 years of
age or older. Sixty-eight percent of the respondents had a high school degree. At the time of the
survey 92 individuals had a mobile phone, 50 used
laptops, 13 had a car navigation system, 11 had a
Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), and 5 used a
smart-phone and/or a Tablet-PC (multiple answers
allowed). When filling out the questionnaire, half
of the respondents were given the additional information that the mobile information service would
be offered absolutely free of charge, while the
other sample half was not provided with this information. The results depicted in Figure 2 show that
mobile information services when offered for free

are considered much more attractive than those
where no price indications was given; thus, respondents would have disproportional cost expectations in mind.
Structured Expert Survey
The final analytical step involved a survey to
capture expert views concerning the relevance of
the identified mobile information services for tourists (Fuchs, Rasinger, Höpken, & Grün, 2007).
Thus, in February 2006, by means of an online
questionnaire, a total of 40 international wellknown industry experts and scientists in the field
of information technologies and tourism were
asked to evaluate the identified mobile information services on a 6-point scale (6 = highly relevant to 1 = completely irrelevant). First, the experts attached great importance to the trend that
tourists will in the future satisfy their information
needs through mobile devices (i.e., the average
score value over all services stood at 4.91). Second, for the majority of information services a
ranking highly similar to that of the final users
emerged. For instance, mobile devices to gather
“transport information,” “event information,” “information on sights,” and “gastronomy & nightlife
information” were given top priority by the experts. In contrast to the final users, however, mobile devices for gathering “weather information &
news” as well as “security information” were classified as being relatively unimportant by the experts.
Modeling the Intention to Use Mobile
Information Services in Tourism
The well-established Technology Acceptance
Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) takes into account
the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of
use for statistically explaining the intention to use
an information system and explains about 40% of
a system’s usage levels (Legris, Ingham, & Collerette, 2003). TAM has been verified and extended
in several ways, following the traditional path of
evaluating systems in a job context. As a consequence, Venkatesh and Davis (2000) introduced
TAM2, extending the original TAM by a number
of key forces underlying judgments towards perceived usefulness, such as subjective norm, volun-

183

tariness, and image. A similar approach was taken
by Rogers (1995), introducing the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT). IDT defines key variables
behind the adoption of innovations. These are the
(1) relative advantage (i.e., degree to which the innovation is perceived as being better than the practice it supersedes), (2) compatibility (i.e., extent to
which adopting the innovation is compatible with
what people do), (3) complexity (i.e., degree to
which an innovation is perceived as relatively difficult to understand and use), (4) trialability (i.e.,
degree to which an innovation may be experimented with before making the adoption or rejection decision), and (5) observability (i.e., degree
to which the results of an innovation are visible to
others) (Kaasinen, 2005). In an attempt to bring
together TAM, IDT, and other predecessor models
[Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein & Ajzen,
1975), Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen,
1991)], Venkatesh, Morris, et al. (2003) empirically tested a Unified Theory of Acceptance and
Use of Technology (UTAUT) and were able to
explain as much as 70% of the variance pertaining
to intentions to use a technological system, thus
claiming a substantial improvement over any of
the original partial models. Due to its high explanatory power, UTAUT was selected as the base
model to explain intentions to use mobile information services to support individual information
search strategies during a trip.
UTAUT theorizes that four constructs play a
significant role as direct determinants of user acceptance and usage behavior (i.e., behavioural intention (BI)), namely performance expectancy
(PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI),
and facilitating conditions (FC). PE is defined as
the degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains
in the respective performance. EE is defined as the
degree of ease associated with the use of the system. Further, SI is defined as the degree to which
an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new system. Finally,
FC are defined as the degree to which an individual believes that an organizational and technical
infrastructure exists to support the use of the system. Venkatesh, Morris, et al. (2003) deliver strong
evidence that the construct FC, as opposed to perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and sub-

184

RASINGER, FUCHS, AND HÖPKEN

jective norm, does not have a significant direct effect on BI. Rather, EE mediates the effect of FC
on usage intention (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000).
Further, a direct influence of FC on usage behavior could be observed. Finally, Venkatesh, Morris,
et al. (2003) found proof for moderating effects of
gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use.
The above models provide a theory-based view
of causes and effects involved in technology acceptance on a clearly technology-independent
level. Thus, UTAUT has to be extended by the
various specifics typical for mobile information
services in tourism. TAMs have so far successfully been used to study user acceptance of Internet services (Barnes & Huff, 2003; Chen, Gillenson, & Sherrell, 2004; Fuchs, Höpken, Lehmann,
& Wöckl, 2006; Lederer, Maupin, Sena, & Zhuang, 2000; Steinbauer & Werthner, 2007) and B2C
e-Commerce applications (Chen et al., 2004). Especially for the latter, aspects such as familiarity
and trust have been included (Gefen, 2000; Lin &
Wang, 2006; Lu, Liu, Yu, & Yao, 2004; Swan,
Bowers, & Richardson, 1999;). Chen et al. (2004)
define trust as feeling secure about relying on an
entity. Swan et al. (1999) detect a positive influence on positive customer attitude, intention to
purchase, and purchasing behavior. Also, tourists
have to rely on information about tourism services
because their experience quality can only be evaluated after consumption (Dunstall et al., 2003).
Thus, trust may be a key driver for intentions to
use an information source, such as a mobile information service (Gefen, 2000; Chen et al., 2004).
More precisely, perceived trust (PT) towards a
mobile service is theorized to directly determine
the BI to use the system.
Mobile information services primarily fulfill
the task of providing tourists with relevant information before, during, and after a trip (Höpken et
al., 2006). In this sense, service quality may be
defined as the discrepancy between the information customers expect and the information customers get from the mobile information service (Chen
et al., 2004). Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry
(1988) identified five dimensions that consumers
use when evaluating service quality: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy.
Based on these constructs, Chae, Kim, Kim, and
Ryu (2002) postulate an empirically tested quality

model for mobile Internet services. The latter comprises four quality constructs: connection quality,
content quality, interaction quality, and contextual
quality. Gefen and Devine (2001) found empirical
evidence that service quality of information systems has a positive influence on both satisfaction
and loyalty. Thus, for the mobile information service acceptance model proposed below, a perceived service quality (PSQ) construct is added as
a direct determinant of PE and an indirect determinant of BI.
Mobile information services, besides being
functional instruments for acquiring information,
also have value for the user due to their ergonomic
and pure hedonic characteristics (De Wulf, Niels,
Muylle, & Rangarajan, 2006; Hassenzahl, 2002).
Fun of use, as it is often called, however, plays a
minor role in the TAM literature (Hassenzahl,
Platz, Burmester, & Lehner, 2000). Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1992) showed that perceived
fun, defined as the extent to which using a software is enjoyable in its own right, has a positive
impact on the intention to use a system given that
the software is perceived as useful. When looking
at this observation, one must bear in mind that
TAM was primarily intended for a job context. In
contrast, for mobile information systems designed
for the tourism domain, the hedonic factor may be
hypothesized to play an important role in determining the behavioral intention to use mobile information systems. Thus, as reported by Hassenzahl, Burmester, and Koller (2003) and Hassenzahl
et al. (2002), perceived hedonic quality (PHQ) was
included to directly influence the BI construct.
Major barriers for mobile service proliferation
are costs and missing cost transparency (A.T.
Kearney, 2004). Acceptance models, however,
due to their job-related backgrounds, only in rare
cases incorporate cost issues. Nevertheless, for
mobile services, Amberg, Wehrmann, and Zimmer
(2004a, 2004b) define perceived costs (PC) as one
of four major determinants of mobile information
service acceptance. Similarly, Köhne, Totz, and
Wehmeyer (2005) include monetary costs by considering pricing models that in many cases lack
transparency. Thus, PC and perceived cost transparency (PCT) have been added to the proposed
acceptance model for mobile information services
in tourism (Fig. 3).

Figure 3. Model of mobile information service acceptance.

Amberg et al. (2004a) and Venkatesh, Morris,
et al. (2003) point out that the importance of the
factors influencing behavioral intention strongly
depends on the user’s familiarity with a system.
Accordingly, in TAM literature familiarity was included as a factor influencing EE. The proposed
model, however, is restricted to users having the
same defined state of familiarity with a system,
such as (T1) post-first contact, (T2) 1 month after,
or (T3) 3 months after, as suggested by Venkatesh,
Morris, et al. (2003) and, thus, familiarity was not
included in the model.
Research Methodology
The research presented in this article was conducted in the preprototype phase when no working
prototype was present (Höpken et al., 2006). Conventional wisdom among system developers as-

serts that prospective users must have direct handson experience with at least a working prototype of
a new system before they can provide assessments
that accurately reflect future usage behavior
(Davis & Venkatesh, 2004). Nevertheless, Davis
and Venkatesh give empirical evidence that this
assumption is only partially true. They point out
that stable and predictive assessments of a system’s perceived ease of use should be based on
experience with the technological system. However, they continue that stable and behaviorally
predictive measures of perceived usefulness can
also be captured from target users who have received information about a system’s functionality,
but have not had direct hands-on usage experience
at all (Davis & Venkatesh, 2004, p. 31). Accordingly, the six most promising mobile information
services identified in the preliminary research
phase (i.e., mobile services providing transport in-

186

formation, event information, information on sights,
gastronomy & nightlife information, weather &
news information, and security information) and
their corresponding functionalities (i.e., search &
browse, recommendation, context-aware push functionalities, mCommerce functionalities, and feedback functionalities) were expressively described
to survey participants using both examples and
typical usage scenarios.
These descriptions served as “device under
test” and were subsequently used to determine attitudes of potential future users. Thus, it is not the
service per se that was evaluated, but rather the
mental picture the participants had of the specific
mobile information service. First, based on service
descriptions, survey participants were asked whether
or not they would use a mobile service that provided these functionalities during their current
stay, and also whether or not they would use a
specific functionality. Each functionality was expected to positively affect the expected BI (Fig. 4a).
The survey was based on a self-administered
questionnaire, thereby reducing the necessary time
for questioning. Furthermore, in contrast to Davis

and Venkatesh (2004), no extensive explanation to
gain a deeper understanding of the various aspects
of the system’s functionalities was given. As a further consequence of evaluating on a very abstract
level, it made sense to employ only two items for
measuring intention to use the functionality and
only one single item for measuring BI on the level
of the mobile information service.
Second, the marketing-related question “Which
prejudices exist towards the most promising mobile information services?” was targeted. As stated
above, in the preprototype phase only the mental
picture of a specific mobile information service
can be evaluated. Thus, the mobile service acceptance model proposed above had to be reduced to
those constructs that would be rather measurable
already in the preprototype phase. Therefore, the
constructs had to be adapted by using expectancies
instead of perceptions (e.g., behavioral intention
→ expected behavioral intention).
A further model adjustment took place with regard to use behavior (UB), which cannot be assessed without the presence of a working prototype, and was therefore omitted from the following

Figure 4. (a) Functional configuration model and (b) expectancy-based acceptance model.

INFORMATION SEARCH WITH MOBILE TOURIST GUIDES
empirical considerations. Further, as only direct
predecessors of BI were included into the preprototype model, PSQ was not considered. In contrast, EE was included as it may allow clear insight into eventual “prejudices” towards the ease
of use of a specific mobile information service. As
already observed in the pilot study, cost perceptions have a major impact on usage intentions towards mobile information services. In order to
prevent a systematic devaluation of BI due to disproportional cost sensitivity, a statement that the
service would be free of charge was added. Thus,
PC and PCT were further omitted from the model.
Each of the remaining expectation constructs
were expected to have a positive impact on the
expected BI (Fig. 4b). According to Davis and
Venkatesh (2004), stable and predictive assessments of a system’s perceived ease of use are not
possible without a working prototype. Therefore,
measures taken besides expected performance
(i.e., usefulness) can be interpreted only as “prejudice” towards these specific service dimensions
(see Fig. 4b). In contrast to the functionality constructs, the expectancy constructs were empirically
measured by only one item. Finally, participants
were asked about their level of innovativeness. For
this aim, the six item-based Domain Specific Innovativeness (DSI) scale (Goldsmith & Hofacker,
1991) was employed. Based on the notion that the
DSI concept was primarily developed to differentiate user groups according to their first usage intention after product release, the variable was not
included as a predictor of BI. Rather, the DSI
scale was employed as a grouping variable to
identify significant group differences among innovators, middle majority, and laggards.
Empirical Results
Survey
A survey comprising 952 German-speaking
tourists was undertaken in Tyrol (Austria) in February 2006. A total of 705 questionnaires could be
used for statistical analyses. The average age of
the participants was 33.6 years with a range from
9 to 64 years. Forty percent of respondents were
female and the majority (92%) declared skiing and
other sports activities as their main purpose of the
current trip, while 3% were present for business

187

reasons. Forty percent of respondents held a high
school, 32% a college, and 28% a university degree. Over half (54.9%) of the respondents visited
Tyrol for 3 days or less and 21.2% booked at least
one tourism service via the Internet. Literature asserts a strong relationship between culture and innovation potential (Fife & Pereira, 2005; Hui,
2004). This is why the survey focused solely on
German-speaking winter tourists. Nevertheless, in
order to gain representative results, at least for
German-speaking skiing tourists, the nationality
distribution within the sample corresponds to the
population distribution in typical alpine tourism
destinations, such as Tyrol (Table 3).
The questionnaire used 6-point Likert scales
(1 = strongly agree to 6 = strongly disagree) and
was divided into three sections. With regard to the
first section participants were asked to give some
information on their mobile phone usage and general innovation habits. In the second questionnaire
section participants were asked to rate the usage
intention of mobile services and corresponding
functionalities for their current stay. In order to
reduce the effort of filling out the questionnaire,
respondents were asked to evaluate only two mobile information services, thereby reducing the
sample size (N) for service-dependent statistical
analyses to 235 on average. Finally, the last section collected information on the current travel
context as well as on sociodemographics.

Table entries are mean values with standard deviations in parentheses. Measurement item (BI): “I would use this service/
functionality for my current stay.” Scale: 6-point Likert scale (1 = strongly agree to 6 = strongly disagree).

In general, the empirical results of the pilot
study were confirmed as the same mobile information services proved to be attractive. More precise,
mobile information services providing information
on weather & news (2.31), transport & navigation
(2.40), and security (2.61) showed lower mean
scores, signifying higher intention to use them.
Thus, product managers should firstly focus on
these mobile services to support tourists’ on-site
information needs. In terms of functionality, feedback was clearly rated as least interesting to users
throughout all services. This supports results from
the focus group interviews where participants declared their skepticism about users entering long
text on their mobile devices, which would be necessary for giving written feedback. When looking
at the various expectancies, the observed services
showed lowest mean values with respect to expected performance (2.45–2.83) and expected effort (2.51–3.28), indicating relatively strong expectancies in terms of performance, but also in
terms of use effort.
Results From Regression Analyses
In a next step, an explorative factor analysis
using principal components analysis with Varimax
rotation was performed in order to aggregate those
item pairs measuring the BI to use each functionality (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 2005). As
reported in Table 5, all the obtained functionality

constructs showed to have a highly satisfactory
construct reliability (i.e., Cronbach alpha well
above 0.75). For determining the optimal functionality configuration for each mobile information
service, multiple regression analyses were performed with the factor score values being the independent variables and the BI to use the mobile information service being the dependent variable
(Hair et al., 2005). Table 5 summarizes the obtained regression results for each of the six examined mobile information services.
First of all, the employed regressive approach
to statistically “explain” the dependent variable
“intention to use a specific information service”
by its typical functionalities proved to be adequate
because for all the six examined mobile services
the corresponding regression model showed significant F-values as well as relatively high adjusted R 2 values (ranging between 0.38 and 0.63).
Secondly, the search & browse functionality can
be classified as a base functionality because it
proved to be significant for all the six examined
mobile information services. Interestingly enough,
for a totality of four information services the context-aware push functionality seems to play a significant role in determining the intention to use
mobile information services while at a destination.
More precisely, for the three most attractive services in the eyes of the customers, namely (1)
transport & navigation, (2) the security assistant
and (3) news & weather service, the corresponding

context-aware push functions are acting as the
most prominent functionalities, which can be seen
from the high and strongly significant standardized regression coefficients (Hair et al., 2005). In
fact, for the security assistant and the transport &
navigation service the push functionality has a
stronger influence on BI than the pull-based functionalities, indicating most interesting usage cases
for push-based systems. Apparently, for security
(e.g., critical warnings, such as storm warnings,
avalanches, etc.) and transport information (e.g.,

traffic jams) the advantages of push-based systems
are most convincing for prospective users. To
summarize, the signs of the emerging significant
regression coefficients were in line with the above
proposed model.
Multiple regression was further employed to
determine the relative influence of expected performance, expected social influence, expected
trust, expected effort of use, and expected hedonic
quality on the BI to use the mobile information
service. As explained above, the exogenous deter-

190

minants of use intention (i.e., independent variable) were measured with a unique manifest variable. Consequently, no statistical measure for the
construct reliability can be indicated. Table 6 summarizes the obtained regression results for each of
the six examined mobile information services in
tourism.
Again, the corresponding regression model
showed significant F-values as well as relatively
high adjusted R2 values (ranging between 0.44 and

0.65). Nevertheless, the obtained results should be
treated with caution. One must keep in mind that
it is not the service that was evaluated, but rather
the mental picture the participants of the survey
had of the specific mobile information service. As
stated earlier, social influence, trust, effort of use
(usability)’, and hedonic quality may be interpreted as major prejudice factors towards mobile information services. The obtained results impressively show in particular the strong influence of

expected effort of use (usability)’ on BI (Table 6).
Thus, participants apparently tend to have services
in mind that would be difficult to use. Possible
reasons are failures of hyped WAP Services in the
past (Forge, 2004) or simply low levels of selfefficacy (Compeau & Higgins, 1995). Interestingly enough, for the mobile transport & navigation service the influence of expected effort of use
(usability) was relatively low. A possible explanation could be a higher state of familiarity with
these systems and, consequently, less skepticism
in terms of usability. To summarize, again, the regression results were in line with the above proposed model.
Results From Analysis of Variances
In a final step, the influence of the users’ affinity towards technology on BI was examined. For
this aim, the six DSI items (Goldsmith & Hofacker,
1991) were subjected to a factor analysis, reducing
the number of items to four as loading commonly
to one factor (Hair et al., 2005). As suggested by
Goldsmith (2001), the z-standardized factor score
values were subsequently used to define three different user groups: innovators (first quartile), middle majority (second and third quartile), and laggards (fourth quartile). Finally, the mean scores of
BI to use both mobile service and corresponding

191

functionalities were statistically compared among
these groups using one-way ANOVA (Hair et al.,
2005). In contrast to the ability to discriminate usage patterns for established mobile services (e.g.,
Mobile Internet, MMS, video-telephony), DSI
showed only little ability to discriminate BI to use
mobile information services in tourism. Significant group differences were observed only for the
services and functionalities listed in Table 7.
To summarize, mean values appertaining to the
group of innovators throughout all the observed
mobile information services and functionalities
were lower than those of both the middle majority
group and the laggards. Significant mean differences could only be observed for the transport and
navigation, news & weather, event, and gastronomy service. Innovators show a higher BI to use
a mobile information service for buying tickets for
public transport and events taking place during
their vacation. Further, innovators rated the news
& weather service as being significantly more useful than members of the middle majority and laggard group. Interestingly enough, for the gastronomy-related information service four out of five
functionalities showed significantly different effects on BI. In particular, innovators seem to be
more susceptible to mobile services providing information on gastronomy services within a tourism destination.

Conclusion

The purpose of the presented study was to propose a method to support investors (e.g., mobile
phone operators), product developers, product
managers, and marketers but also destination managers in their complex decision process regarding
both development and marketing of mobile tourist
guides. Light was shed onto the usage potential
of mobile information services supporting on-site
tourist information search, particularly for the urban-alpine setting.
To conclude, the presented empirical study can
be defined as a snapshot of users’ (i.e., tourists)
expectancies and prejudices regarding mobile information services supporting information search
during a vacation. Thus, one must keep in mind
that it was not the service per se that was evaluated, but rather the mental image the survey participants (i.e., alpine tourists) had in mind of a specific mobile information service. Nevertheless, the
survey results can strongly contribute to enhancing
future requirement definitions for mobile information service prototypes. However, future research
efforts should be based on both the establishment
of working prototypes as well as the extensive
gathering and analysis of usage data, thereby comprehensively validating the proposed acceptance
model for mobile information services.
