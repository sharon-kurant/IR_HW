Abstract. Many studies have investigated personalized information presentation in the context of mobile museum guides. In order to provide such a service,
information about museum visitors has to be collected and visitors have to be
monitored and modelled in a non-intrusive manner. This can be done by using
known museum visiting styles to classify the visiting style of visitors as they
start their visit. Past research applied ethnographic observations of the behaviour of visitors and qualitative analysis (mainly site studies and interviews with
staff) in several museums to define visiting styles. The current work validates
past ethnographic research by applying unsupervised learning approaches to
visitors classification. By providing quantitative empirical evidence for a qualitative theory we claim that, from the point of view of assessing the suitability of
a qualitative theory in a given scenario, this approach is as valid as a manual
annotation of museum visiting styles.

1 Introduction
The museum environment is an attractive arena in which to develop and experiment
with ambient intelligence in general and personalized information delivery in particular. Many studies have investigated personalized information presentation in the context of mobile museum guides [1]. Regarding the user characteristics that need to be
modelled, most approaches focus on history of interaction and user interests. For
example, the GUIDE system presented in [2] adapts web-like presentations by adding
information about nearby attractions that might be interesting for the visitor of a city.
The HIPPIE system proposes personalized tours in a museum by maintaining a model
of user interests and knowledge [3]. The REAL system [4] adapts route descriptions
according to the actual user position, the limited technical resources of the device, and
the cognitive resources of the user. In the context of the PEACH project [5] a spreading activation technique applied on a domain knowledge-base was implemented to
predict the interest in concepts related to those for which the system received explicit
feedback from the user.
Knowledge-related features are not, however, the only sources of information
that are worth considering for modelling a museum visitor. For example, Petrelli and
C. Conati, K. McCoy, and G. Paliouras (Eds.): UM 2007, LNAI 4511, pp. 238–246, 2007.

Analyzing Museum Visitors’ Behavior Patterns

Not [6] suggest taking into consideration whether the user is visiting the museum
alone or with companions, whether she is a first-time or a recurrent visitor, and so on.
Behavioural traits have also been taken into consideration. Sparacino [7] proposed
categorization of user types into three main categories: (i) the greedy visitor who
wants to know and see as much as possible; (ii) the selective visitor who spends time
on artefacts that represent certain concepts only and neglects the others; and (iii) the
busy visitor who prefers strolling through the museum in order to get a general idea of
the exhibition without spending much time on any exhibits. Her application employs
Bayesian networks to model both the user (interest and style) and the appropriateness
of the guide’s content (length and order).
The same categorization of user types is also used by Hatala and Wakkary [8] together with an ontology-based model of the interests. In both these papers, the validity of such a scheme is justified through qualitative analysis, mainly site studies and
interviews with staff at various museums.
In this paper, we will focus on the classification of the visiting style proposed by
the ethno methodologists Veron and Levasseur [9]. Starting from ethnographic observations of the behaviour of a number of visitors in several museums, they argued that
visitors’ movements may be compared to the behaviour of four “typical” animals, and
they proposed using this strategy as a way of classifying the “style” of a visitor. Specifically, they suggests that the ANT visitor tends to follow a specific path and spends
a lot of time observing almost all the exhibits; the FISH visitor most of the time
moves around in the centre of the room and usually avoids looking at exhibits' details;
the BUTTERFLY visitor does not follow a specific path but rather is guided by the
physical orientation of the exhibits and stops frequently to look for more information;
finally, the GRASSHOPPER visitor seems to have a specific preference for some preselected exhibits and spends a lot of time observing them while tending to ignore the
others. Of course, it might be expected that a given visitor can change her behaviour
during a long visit, and it is also possible that the style is affected by the specific
interests.
The first attempt to exploit this classification as part of a user model for a mobile
guide was in the HIPS project (see mainly [10]) where a Recurrent Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) was trained to recognize the visiting style of a visitor given her interaction history. This model was then employed for selecting and tailoring information
to the visitor [11]. Although most of the ideas tested experimentally in HIPS underwent user evaluation, the very idea of the existence of visiting styles was taken for
granted relying on the qualitative analysis of the original work.
Chittarro and Ieronutti [12] employed Veron and Levasseur's classification in the
context of a tool that visualizes users’ behaviours in a virtual environment. Their use
of the visiting styles was based on qualitative analysis and, again, they did not evaluate the existence of these classes.
In this paper, we are trying to take a step back; we would like to discuss a methodology for validating empirically Veron and Levasseur’s model of visiting style. We
used log files of 140 visitors exploring a frescoed room with a multimedia museum
guide to provide quantitative-based evidence that museum visitors’ behavior may
effectively be classified according to Veron and Levasseur’s model. We used two
unsupervised learning techniques (K-means and Auto-Associative ANN) to cluster
the visitors’ behaviours. The clustering produced by both techniques may be assumed

240

to characterize Veron and Levasseur’s four animals. An agreement analysis conducted
on the classifications schemes determined by clustering membership revealed a high
level of agreement between the two techniques.
This work is intended to complement Veron and Levasseur's ethnographic study by
providing empirical evidence for it as well as to provide information in a principled
way for further research on user modelling. Our claim, as discussed in the last section,
is that this approach may complement—if not replace—reliability analysis of observation schemes derived from qualitative research such as Veron and Levasseur’s.

2 Data Collection and Preparation
In the context of a user study of a multimedia mobile guide [13], 143 regular visitors
to Torre Aquila1 in Trento were invited to test the system. Each visitor was requested
to visit Torre Aquila with a multimedia guide (although adaptive guides were experimented in Torre Aquila [14], a non-adaptive version was employed for this study).
Among the subjects, 61 were males and 82 females. Their age ranged from 20 to 79
years (mean=47, median=50, std.dev=15.9). All were recruited at the entrance of the
museum and received a free ticket to visit the castle as a reward for participating in
the data collection.
Out of the 143 visit logs, 140 were used for this study; the rest had various errors
that prevented their use. The average visit time was 22 minutes, and average time
spent in front an exhibit was 4 minutes with standard deviation of 70 seconds. The
system automatically logged the visitors’ movements in the space (by means of IR
sensors) and all their interaction with the museum visitors’ guide.
Since we are interested—at this stage—in analyzing the visitors’ behavior rather
than in predicting the visiting style from the interaction history, we used measures
relating to the entire visit rather than temporal-based indices. The measures used for
the analysis were the average time spent at each position, the percentage of exhibits
visited, a numerical representation between 0 and 1 of the order of the visit (where 1
means that the visitor spent some time on each exhibit and 0 that she did not stop at
any exhibit), and a combined description of visitors’ behavior, taking into account
interaction and whether or not visitors played fully through complete presentations.
Further, four cumulative measures were defined considering the percentage of the
visit for which the visitor was: (A) interacting with the guide (i.e., asking for more
information), but not reaching the conclusion of the presentations; (B) interacting and
reaching conclusions; (C) not interacting and not reaching conclusions; and (D) not
interacting but reaching conclusions.
Data pre-processing generated 140 7-dimensional vectors including the average
time, visit order and completeness, and the percentage of the visit for which the visitor’s behavior was according to each of the four types (checking for each and every

Torre Aquila is a tower at the Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy where a fresco called “The
Cycle of the Months,” a masterpiece of the gothic period, is to be found. This fresco, painted
in the Fifteenth Century, covers all fours walls of a room in the tower and illustrates the activities of aristocrats and peasants throughout the year. The museum guide used to collect visitor data is one of the many prototypes developed in the PEACH project; for more details

position whether the visitor interacted with the system or not and whether he/she
viewed complete presentations or not and then calculating the ratios).

3 Analysis of Museum Visitors’ Behavior
The visit logs representation was used as an input to an auto-associative ANN and to a
K-means clustering algorithm, both of which clustered the data into four clusters in
order to validate the Veron and Levasseur classification and see if their visitors’ types
might be identified.
3.1 Unsupervised Learning with Auto-Associative ANN
Artificial neural networks are used to form data-driven models. In order to perform
unsupervised learning, an auto-associative ANN (AA-ANN), in which the “targets”
are identical to the inputs, was used. If the trained AA-ANN succeeds in replicating
the inputs as outputs, it means that the hidden neurons are encoding the essential information “distilled” from the inputs features. In most cases the outputs of the hidden
neurons are close to either one or zero [15]. Thus all examples that generate the same
hidden neurons output pattern are deemed to belong to the same cluster.

As explained above, the data consisted of 140 visit summary examples with seven
visit attributes named: AvT (Average time), A, B, C, D, Order (of the visit) and Completeness (percentage of frescos visited). The AA-ANN used was a fully-connected,
feed-forward ANN of two hidden neurons and seven output neurons, each having the
sigmoidal transfer function, which was presented with the dataset with the seven input
variables and the identical values as targets. The input data were preprocessed by
subtracting the mean value of each attribute column, and dividing by the standard
deviation of each column. These values were further re-scaled to the 0.1-0.9 range to
serve as the AA-ANN targets. The training was done by the Guterman-Boger set of
algorithms that starts with non-random connection weights and employs proprietary
algorithms for avoiding entering, and escaping from, local minima encountered during the training [16, 17]. The “binary” pattern of the hidden neurons was used for
clustering [18]. The average attribute values of the examples in each cluster were
divided by the average of the attribute values of the full dataset. The results are shown
in Table 1.
The ratios of the attributes that are higher than 1.5 are marked bold, and those with
ratios smaller than 0.5 are underlined. It can be seen that cluster # 1 has a high ratio of

242

M. Zancanaro et al.

the B variable, cluster # 2 has a high ratio of variable D, cluster # 4 has a high ratio of
variable A, and cluster # 3 has a high ratio of attribute C. The attributes Av T, Order
and Completeness apparently do not contribute much to the clusters’ formation, although it may be that cluster 1 may have a somewhat higher mean Av T.
Hence Cluster 1 seems to correspond to an ANT type (long, ordered and interactive, and gets complete presentations) and cluster 3 corresponds to a FISH type
(short visit, without getting complete presentations). Cluster 2 corresponds to a
GRASSHOPPER (tends to get more complete presentations than BUTTERFLY) and
cluster 4 to a BUTTERFLY (less ordered and does not get complete presentations).
After the clustering, we also used an ANOVA [19] with the clusters identified as a
factor and the cumulative indexes outlined above as dependent variables. Significant
differences were found at p < 0.001 along all the variables except Order and Completeness. Table 2 summarizes the results.

A Bonferroni [20] post-hoc analysis validated the analysis of the ANN results
above and showed that:
•

•

Visitors in cluster 1 take more time than visitors in the other clusters when
visiting the exhibits; they are less “A” than 4; they are more “B” than all the
others; they are less “C” than 3 and less “D” than 2 and 3. Therefore visitors
in clusters 1 exhibit the traits of the visitors’ style defined as ANT;
Visitors in cluster 2 take less time than 1 but more than 3; they are less “A”
than 4; they are less “B” than 1 and 4; they are less “C” than 3 and more
“D” than 1,3 and 4; therefore visitors in cluster 2 may be ascribed to the visitors’ style defined as GRASSHOPER (i.e., closer to an ant than to a fish)

Visitors in cluster 3 take less time than 1 and 2; they are less A than 4; they
are less “B” than 1 and 4; they are more “C” than all the others and more
“D” than 1 and 4 but less than 2; therefore they belong to FISH;
Finally, visitors in cluster 4 take less time than 1; they are more “A” than all
the others; they are less “B” than 1 but more than 2 and 3; they are less “C”
than 3 and less “D” than 2 and 3; they appear to belong to the style
BUTTERFLY (i.e., closer to a fish than to an ant).

3.2 Unsupervised Learning with K-Means
As an alternative way of clustering the cumulative measures, we employed the
K-means algorithm [21].
In order to reduce the number of variables, we ran a Factor analysis (Principal
Components Analysis with varimax rotation). The results showed that 81% of the
variance can be explained by 4 factors while Order and Completeness show very
low correlation with any factor. Table 3 shows the contribution of the cumulative
variables on the four principal factors.

We classify the visitors in 4 clusters using K-means analysis starting from the factors.
A one-way ANOVA [19], using the cumulative indexes as dependent variables and
the clusters determined by K-means as a factor, showed that for all the variables there
are statistical differences except for Order and Completeness (see Table 4).
A post-hoc analysis using the Bonferroni [20] test showed that:
•

•
•

Visitors in cluster 1 take less time than visitors in cluster 2 and more than
visitors in cluster 4; they are less A than 2; less “B” than 2 and 3; less “C”
than 4; and more “D” than all the others; therefore they may be ascribed to
the style of GRASSHOPPER (closer to an ant than to a fish);
Visitors in cluster 2 take more time than all the others; are less A than 3; are
more “B” than 1 and 3; less “C” than 4; and less “D” than 1 and 4; therefore
they share many of the traits of ANT;
Visitors in cluster 3 take less time than 2; they are less A than all the others;
more “B” than 1 and less than 2; less “C” than 4; and less “D” than 1 and 4;
therefore they resembles visitors belonging to the style of BUTTERFLY
(closer to a fish than to an ant);

3.3 Comparison of the Two Approaches
In order to assess to what extent the two clustering algorithms agree on classification
of the visitors into the different visitors styles, we used the κ statistics [22] which
provides a better estimation of the bare percentage agreement since it takes into account the possibility of chance agreement.
Table 5 shows the confusion matrix. The value of the κ statistics in our case is
0.860 with a standard error of 0.035 (p<0.0001; N=140). According to Landis and
Koch’s criteria [23], the agreement is very good (κ > 0.8).

4 Discussion, Conclusions and Future Work
Qualitative theories from sociology and other disciplines are often used as a starting
point for building computational models of human behavior to be exploited in intelligent systems. Usually, a human expert manually labels a number of examples, and a
supervised learning approach is employed to predict in a real situation the behavior of
users according to the theory, as modelled (or “learned” by the system). In order to
test the objectivity of the observation scheme, reliability analysis is often employed:
two or more annotators code a number of sequences, and an agreement analysis is
performed by computing Cohen’s Kappa (or other similar indexes) and by looking at
the confusion matrix. In this paper, we tried to provide quantitative empirical evidence for a qualitative theory. We employed two unsupervised learning techniques for
clustering museum visitors' behavior patterns and showed how the clusters obtained
from them may be explained in the terms of the theory. We claim that from the point
of view of assessing the suitability of a qualitative theory in a given scenario, this
approach is as valid as a manual annotation with reliability analysis.
Furthermore, the labels automatically produced may then be used by a supervised
learning approach to predict the classes to which visitors belong, as they enter the
museum. From a pragmatic point of view, this procedure is cheaper—and less error
prone—than manual annotation, especially when a large corpus of data has to be
annotated.
Of course, we are not proposing that quantitative approaches may simply substitute
qualitative approaches in building computational models of human behavior: the two
types of approaches have different strengths and, to some extent, different purposes.
Rather, we discussed a technique whose aim is to provide a quantitative validation of
a particular qualitative theory.
Future research will focus on predicting visitors’ behavior type using information
collected during the first period of the visit. We intend to evaluate the correlation
between the cumulative data representing the whole visit used for clustering in this
work, with partial information available at the beginning of the visit of the same visitors. The results may allow us to use the clustering results as labels for prediction
visiting style with partial data.
Additional future research will try to correlate the current clustering results with
other notions of visitor’s types (such as, for example, Sparacino’s [7] and others).
