Acknowledgements
This dissertation Affordances, Appropriation and Experience in Museum Exhibitions:
Visitors’ (Eye) Movement Patterns and the Influence of Digital Guides emerged from the
research project Wissen & Museum: Archiv – Exponat – Evidenz (Knowledge & Museum:
Archive – Exhibit – Evidence; from 2009 until 2012) that was developed between the Institute
for Empirical Studies and the Institute for Art History at the University of Tuebingen, the
German Literature Archive (Deutsches Literaturarchiv, DLA) in Marbach with its affiliated
museums and the Knowledge Media Research Centre (KMRC) Tuebingen, which is an extrafaculty research institute that is part of the Leibniz Association. First, I would like to thank the
German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF; funding number 01UB0909)
for funding this research from 2009 until 2012 and the University of Cologne for funding this
research with a re-entry program position after my maternity leave in 2015.
This dissertation would never have been possible without the support of many people. I thank
the curator Ingrid Heermann and the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart as well as the head of the
literature museums Heike Gfrereis and the Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach a. N. who both
opened their exhibitions for my visitor research. Furthermore I am thankful to Martin OttoHörbrand from the Linden-Museum for providing me with all of the information and help I
asked for during the entire research process. Big thanks are also owed to Tonwelt, the audio
guide company that shared their text and audio files of the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition and gave their permission to reprint it in this
thesis. I deeply thank Andreas Sobotka from the DLA who was responsible for the
multimedia museum guide (M3) and its content management (CMS) system. He introduced
me into the CMS of the M3 and provided the CMS data. I am also grateful to Melanie
Waldheim for kindly permitting me to quote her research results about the visitors of the
Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach a. N. in my thesis.
Furthermore I would like to thank the KMRC for providing and purchasing mobile eye
trackers for use in the field. Many thanks also go to the IT-Support Team of the KMRC in
Tuebingen for their support throughout the research process. Furthermore I am grateful for all
the students who assisted me during this research project, including Linda Greci, Marie-Luise
Saile, Julia Bahnmüller, and Noreen Eberle, who all did great jobs transcribing, collecting
data and supporting parts of the data analysis.

i

I am also thankful to Professor Thomas Widlok for his pragmatic advice and valuable
comments and support during the whole process. Many thanks go to Professor Klaus
Schneider for his openness to visitor studies and for his useful comments on the draft. I would
like to thank Professor Stephan Schwan – who was also my boss at the Knowledge Media
Research Centre from 2009-2012 – for his openness to anthropological theory and methods
and his useful comments and support during the whole process.
I also thank the project partners at the University of Tuebingen, especially Professor Thomas
Thiemeyer, our project leader, for bringing together scientists from various disciplines
productively together and supporting me. The professors Anke te Heesen, Bernhard Tschofen
and especially Barbara Lange are much appreciated for their interest in and comments on my
research, as are my colleagues Yvonne Schweizer and Felicitas Hartmann for their interest in
my work, their valuable comments and their supporting colleagueship. Additional colleagues
at the KMRC provided their help include Daniela Bauer, Kristin Knipfer, Karsten Krauskopf,
Tim Kühl and Daniel Wessel. Big thanks go to each of them.
Thanks also go to Emma Steinbach who proofread my translations of German original
exhibition texts and digital guide texts into English as well as Lindsay Springer and Daina
Crafa for proof reading this thesis.
I am also very grateful to the museum visitors who participated in my research and shared
their exhibition experience and appropriation with me. They provided the basis for this
research, and this thesis would not have been possible without them.
I definitely do not take all the help and support for granted. Without it this thesis would not be
possible. So thank you all!
In the end, a personal note:
While being pregnant with my PhD thesis I adopted my human child, a cute little baby boy.
Being a scientist and a mom at the same time was the greatest adventure ever. Besides being
grateful for all the support I got for my PhD thesis from so many people, I want to thank my
husband and my son for their love and support! I especially thank my husband for his IT
support. I also thank him and my son for waiting for me and being proud that “mom is writing
five books”. I dedicate this thesis to my lovely husband and my lovely son. Thanks for the
joint adventurous journey!

Prologue
Visitor and audience research in museums is a rapidly growing area (Falk & Dierking 2013)
that began with the “turn to the visitor” (Hooper-Greenhill 2006: 362). Presently visitor
research is becoming increasingly important in academia although it is often not yet
sufficiently considered by exhibition makers when designing exhibitions (Reussner 2010).
Visitor research is conducted by various disciplines, mainly sociology, socio-cultural
anthropology, psychology and educational science.
The visitor research presented in this thesis Affordances, Appropriation and Experience in
Museum Exhibitions: Visitors’ (Eye) Movement Patterns and the Influence of Digital Guides
was part of the German interdisciplinary cooperation project Wissen & Museum: Archiv –
Exponat – Evidenz (Knowledge & Museum: Archive – Exhibit – Evidence, 2009-2012)
between the Ludwig-Uhland-Institute for Empirical Studies (LUI) and the Institute for Art
History at the University of Tuebingen, the German Literature Archive (Deutsches
Literaturarchiv, DLA) in Marbach a. N. with its affiliated museums and the Knowledge
Media Research Centre (KMRC) Tuebingen, an extra-faculty research institute that is part of
the Leibniz Association. The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry of
Education and Research. It consisted of four sub-projects respectively: “Spaces of Literature”
conducted by Thomas Thiemeyer and advised by Bernhard Tschofen (LUI); “Materials of
Literature” conducted by Felicitas Hartmann and advised by Anke te Heesen (LUI);
“Iconicity of Literature” conducted by Yvonne Schweizer and advised by Barbara Lange (art
history); and finally “Presentation Practice and Evidence Attribution” conducted by myself
and advised by Stephan Schwan (KMRC). My subproject integrated socio-cultural
anthropology and psychology.
The goal of this interdisciplinary cooperation project was two-fold. On the one hand the aim
was to gain knowledge about museum transformations, from the archival material to the
exhibit at the German Literature Archive with its affiliated museums. We sought to create an
exhibition and generate knowledge about exhibitions that was newer than each discipline
could provide and that was generalizable to all exhibitions. A second aim was to train
scientific and museum staff at the same time. Each scientific staff member was also a trainee
at the literature museums in Marbach. Hence each one of us was working between different
disciplines and between academia and museums as well.
Thus it was a challenging interdisciplinary project. This project was characterized by the
exchange between the disciplines and by (re)drawing boundaries between all the disciplines
xxi

that are part of so-called museum studies. Each of the staff members as well as the
supervising professors were open to and interested in the knowledge and practice of the other
disciplines.
This project ultimately resulted in the exhibition “1912 – Ein Jahr im Archiv” (“1912 – One
Year in the Archive”) and the final conference “Präsenz – ausstellen, erfahren, erforschen”
(“Presence – Exhibiting, Experiencing, Researching”) in 2012. For further information about
the project see http://www.wissen-und-museum.uni-tuebingen.de/.
My tasks included conducting visitor studies in the temporary special “South Sea Oases: Life
and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition (original title: “Südsee-Oasen: Leben und
Überleben im Westpazifik”) at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart and in the permanent “nexus”
exhibition at the Museum of Modern Literature (LiMo) in Marbach a. n. This visitor research
sought distinct, recurrent and systematic eye movement patterns in museum exhibitions and
described them on the micro level in order to provide design suggestions for exhibition
makers. Therefore it applied, among other methods, a recent approach in visitor studies:
mobile eye tracking. Additionally it examined the influence of digital guides. Furthermore, as
part of a minor aim, it investigated the differences between experts and novices.
This thesis was developed within the interdisciplinary project Knowledge & Museum with its
openness, interests, aims and challenges. Hence, it will challenge its readers and ask them to
be open and interested in something different from traditional anthropology. It aims to
contribute to the application of new methods both in visitor studies and socio-cultural
anthropology, and to initiate a new cognitive science approach in visitor studies by combining
psychological and anthropological theories and methods.

Abstract and Thesis Outline
This thesis Affordances, Appropriation and Experience in Museum Exhibitions: Visitors’
(Eye) Movement Patterns and the Influence of Digital Guides emerged of the BMBF-project
Knowledge & Museum. My task within this interdisciplinary project was to conduct visitor
research in the permanent exhibition “nexus” at the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach
a. N. This task was complemented and extended by visitor research in the temporary special
exhibition “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” at the LindenMuseum in Stuttgart.
Visitors are usually not allowed to physically touch the exhibits in an exhibition but they are
encouraged to ‘touch’ the exhibits with their gaze instead. They are invited to view exhibits.
They are invited to read labels and other information panels.
Based on such fundamental principles, the main aims of this project were to gain new
knowledge about visitor eye movement behaviour1 and accompanying cognitive processes
surrounding the particular affordances of exhibition design and hence particular appropriation
strategies. To accomplish this, I applied a new method in visitor studies and socio-cultural
anthropology: mobile eye tracking (MET). Previous visitor movement behaviour research has
mainly been conducted by observation. By using MET, new insights can be gained into the
micro level of visitor movement behaviour. Furthermore using MET allows us to seek the
emic point of view in its very literal sense, which is the anthropological agenda as established
by its founder Malinowski in 1922. The new MET method was combined with cued
retrospective reporting to gain knowledge about the goals of visitors’ that underlie their
attentional behaviour and thus the meaning of their movements. Thus MET works as a
complementary method. The digital guides that were provided in these two exhibitions – an
audio guide and a tablet like medium – were investigated in regard to their influence on visitor
movement behaviour. Thus I will provide new insights into the museum experience with and
without digital guides. Furthermore, it was a minor aim to investigate the differences between
experts and novices.
The overarching aim of my research was not a simple evaluation of curatorial messages being
transferred by the exhibits and exhibitions and received by the visitor, although this was the
initial idea in exploring the field. Contrarily I chose to rely on complex basic research about

1

In the following text I will refer to (eye) movement patterns or (eye) movement behaviour always as movement
patterns or movement behaviour, whereas I imply that the eye is always included in these movements.

xxiii

visitors’ eye, head and body movement behaviour and their accompanying cognitive
processes.
Eighteen distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns could be identified by applying
MET in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the
Linden-Museum in Stuttgart, which could be classified according to their appearances and
possible utilities. These are unique and innovative results, which make evident the fact that
visitors’ movement behaviours are more complex than just stopping and attending to
particular exhibits. Rather movement behaviours comprise several unconscious movement
patterns that serve the exploration of exhibitions and exhibits in a detailed manner from the
visitors’ own perspective. The distinctness of these movement patterns was successfully
confirmed firstly, with a completely different method, systematic observation, applied in the
same exhibition and secondly, in a completely different exhibition, the “nexus” exhibition at
the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach a. N., again with MET. In sum, after applying
these confirmation methods, 26 movement patterns and sub-patterns were found altogether in
both exhibitions.
Note that the two exhibitions are quite different as the descriptions of them in Chapter 3 will
show. They are different because of their subject matter but also in many other aspects. Due to
these differences these exhibitions provided a great range of typical exhibition situations,
which led to the identification of this relatively large number of movement patterns (i.e., 26).
Nevertheless the comparability between both MET studies is given because both exhibitions
avoid directing visitors down a single or main pathway. Instead both exhibitions allow
explorative free viewing, which was the requested task of the visitors included in this study in
order to elicit their eye movement patterns.
My research focuses on the influence of exhibitions’ affordances on visitors’ eye, head and
body movement behaviours. These affordances are created by the selection of exhibits and
digital guides and their presentation and design. For example, exhibits can be presented
freestanding or in display cabinets. The design of the display cabinets may vary from being
only viewable from the front side to being display cabinets made completely of glass that
even have glass shelves. The presentations and designs of exhibits can be homogenous or
heterogeneous. They can be presented hanging or lying on a shelf or a platform.
The influence of digital guides like the audio guide at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart and the
tablet-like guide at the Museum of Modern Literature were examined. The main finding was
that digital guides direct movement patterns and focus attention in a straightforward manner.
xxiv

Hence the usage of digital guides leads to more and to broader ranges of different movement
patterns; thus visitors using digital media tend to be more actively engaged visually and
cognitively when visiting museums than visitors who were not using digital guides. The main
difference between audio guides and tablet-like guides is that audio guides allow a dual or
parallel way of appropriation by viewing exhibits and listening to the audio guide at the same
time, whereas tablet-like guides without the audio guide function only allow a successive but
extended way of appropriation shifting between exhibit/exhibition and guide.
Besides the exhibitions’ affordances and their influence on visitors’ eye movement
behaviours, investigating the difference between general content experts (socio-cultural
anthropologists and literary scholars/Germanists) and novices was a minor aim; hence visitor
characteristics were not collected and investigated. The comparison between experts and
novices showed that individuals of both groups behave and process similarly when viewing
exhibitions, although experts are more active visitors than novices. These results may reflect
the selection of experts in this study, because they were not experts on the particular
exhibition theme or the material culture that was exhibited. After a final review of the
findings, it can be concluded that differences between visitors are primarily determined by
digital guides rather than by expert status.
The results of this basic research, firstly, demonstrate that visitor movement behaviours are
much more complex than previous visitor research studies have concluded. It provides
evidence that 26 movement patterns including variations are used to view exhibits and
exhibitions in detail from the visitors’ own perspective, and highly welcomes further research
on these identified movement patterns, especially cross-cultural research. Secondly, this
research will inform the influence of digital guides on visitor movement behaviour. Thirdly,
findings from this research can help inform exhibition makers about exhibition design on a
micro level and suggestions from these findings can be drawn to support use of visitor-centred
exhibition designs. In order to present the benefits of visitor-centred exhibition designs,
anthropological and psychological theories and methods are combined in a way that creates a
new cognitive science approach to visitor studies. Finally yet importantly this thesis shall
enable visitor researchers and socio-cultural anthropologists to decide whether MET could be
advantageous and applicable for their field research.
The research and relevant background, theoretical terms, and concepts were outlined as
follows:

xxv

Chapter 1 introduces visitor research in general and in socio-cultural anthropology, its
methods and previous findings about visitor circulation behaviour and use of digital guides, as
well as (my) reasons for conducting visitor research as a socio-cultural anthropologist. This
chapter describes MET as a new method and introduces the research questions and aims in
detail.
Chapter 2 introduces three main important terms and concepts that are helpful to investigate
visitors’ movement patterns and the influence of digital guides: “affordance” (Gibson 1979),
appropriation, and museum experience. This chapter looks briefly at museums as a research
area in general, and in particular, ethnographic and literature museums.
Chapter 3 provides a detailed description of the research settings. The “South Sea Oases: Life
and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition and its audio guide at the Linden-Museum in
Stuttgart. The “nexus” exhibition and its multimedia museums guide called the ‘M3’ at the
Museum of Modern Literature (LiMo) in Marbach a. N., including floor plans, photographs
and original texts of the exhibitions.
Chapter 4 describes the results of the first MET study conducted in the “South Sea Oases:
Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart.
Eighteen distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns are identified and described in
detail. Additionally, this chapter provides the frequencies of the movement patterns at four
selected sections demonstrating the level of frequencies and hence level of affordances’
perception (primary, secondary, tertiary and no frequencies). Furthermore it focuses
exemplarily on movement behaviour and accompanying cognitive processes of experts and
novices.
Chapter 5 describes the results of the systematic observation study conducted in the “South
Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in
Stuttgart at four selected sections. It describes the confirmation of the movement patterns and
the investigation of the audio guide’s influence on these patterns. Furthermore this chapter
provides examples of cognitive processes reported by a subset of visitors that were
additionally interviewed directly after they were observed.
Chapter 6 describes the results of the second MET study conducted in the “nexus” exhibition
at the LiMo. It proves most of the movement patterns identified in the “South Sea Oases: Life
and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in a completely
different exhibition and thus provides first evidence for possible generalizability of the
research findings. Additionally further movement patterns were identified in the “nexus”
xxvi

exhibition. Furthermore it compares exemplary descriptions of movement behaviour and
accompanying cognitive processes of one expert and one novice who did not use the digital
guide M3 with one expert and one novice who did use it.
Chapter 7 critically reflects on the methods applied in this research by emphasizing their
limitations, potentials, and prospects as well as by describing exemplarily the reactions they
triggered in the social environment of the research, such as in participants, project partners,
colleagues, museum staff and the press.
Finally, in Chapter 8 the research results will be summarized (Chapter 4-6) and linked to
research results from previous studies (Chapter 1) and the theoretical terms and concepts
(Chapter 2). Based on the specific exhibitions (“South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the
Western Pacific” and “nexus” presented in Chapter 3), I answer the research questions,
provide a list of all 26 identified movement patterns, and discuss which conclusions or design
suggestions can be given. Furthermore, I will anticipate the future of digital guides in
exhibitions, MET in visitor studies, the new cognitive science approach in visitor studies and
future visitor research.
Please note that small parts of some aspects of this thesis were already published due to the
expectations of the Knowledge & Museum project. Single aspects of Chapter 1 were already
published by Eghbal-Azar, Merkt, Bahnmueller and Schwan (2016) and Eghbal-Azar &
Widlok (2013). Eghbal-Azar & Widlok (2013) dealt with parts of the methodological
reflection also covered in Chapter 7 in my expanded discussion concerning the pros and cons
of MET in visitor studies and social sciences generally. Furthermore this publication
contained single movement patterns discussed at length in Chapter 4 and 6. In addition, parts
of the research procedure, especially the instruction for the participating visitors in both MET
studies, and a simple version of both MET study sample tables were already included in
Eghbal-Azar & Widlok (2013). Similarly, parts of the “nexus” exhibition description were
already published in Eghbal-Azar (2013). These publications also include the publication of a
few figures mentioned in the respective chapters.

1. Introduction: Behaviour of Museum Visitors and Methods in Visitor Studies and
Socio-Cultural Anthropology
This first chapter will introduce the research aims and relevant visitor research in
anthropology and other disciplines. It will firstly introduce the wider scope of this research
and provide reasons why socio-cultural anthropologists should conduct visitor studies.
Secondly, it will describe the main methods in visitor studies and socio-cultural anthropology
and it will introduce the recent method MET. Thirdly, it will describe how museum visitors
move through exhibitions and how they use digital media. Finally, the first chapter will
describe gaps in knowledge about museum visitors – hence what we still need to know about
their movement patterns and their use of digital guides in museum exhibitions – by
introducing the research questions, aims and applied methods.

1.1. Visitor Studies in Socio-Cultural Anthropology?!
Museums are becoming increasingly important due to their increasing number (Falk &
Dierking 2013, Te Heesen 2012) as well as their function as informal learning settings
(Schwan 2015). Thus museum visitor studies are becoming increasingly important as well,
especially since the “turn to the visitor” (Hooper-Greenhill 2006: 362). Due to this turn
museums focus more on their visitors. Before this turn museums focused more on their
objects, which raises several questions: Why should socio-cultural anthropologists conduct
visitor research? Why should visitor research be conducted in a literature museum? Why
should visitor research even be conducted at home in Germany?
The anthropologists Mary Bouquet (2001) and Eric Gable (2010) provide some answers to
these questions. In 2001 Mary Bouquet describes how academic anthropology is recently
interested again in museums. This is demonstrated in the book Academic Anthropology and
the Museum: Back to the Future, which she edited. Bouquet believes the “(re-) invention of
museum anthropology” (Bouquet 2001: 1) started with the academic involvement in postcolonial museums and the reshaping of ethnographic museums ‘at home’. Another reason for
the revival of academic interest in museums is provided by Gable’s (2010) argumentation in
his article Ethnografie: Das Museum als Feld (Ethnography: The Museum as Field). He
quotes Laura Naders (1972) that anthropologists need “to study up”. Usually and formerly
socio-cultural anthropologists rather studied the underprivileged. This is part of the political
agenda of socio-cultural anthropologists who themselves feel on the edge of their homeland
society. Hence, according to Gable, “to study up” also includes socio-cultural research in
1

museums. According to Gable (2010) and Bouquet (2001) this also means studying other
museums besides ethnographic ones, like art and science museums for example.
As I will show in Chapter 2, literature museums like the LiMo work similarly to art museums.
Hence I follow Gable’s recommendation “to study up” by conducting research not only in an
ethnographic museum but also in a German literature museum. However, since I focus on
visitors who are commonly not seen as high-ranking within the museum hierarchy (Gable
2010) and I do not focus on museum work “behind the scenes” like the anthropologist Sharon
Macdonald (2002) did, my work is still intermingled with that old political agenda of
speaking for the underprivileged.
Of course, at this point we have to differentiate between Germany and Anglo-Saxon countries
like Britain, USA and Australia, for example. Whereas in Anglo-Saxon countries visitor
research has a longer tradition and hence a greater amount of visitor studies were conducted
that have a greater impact, visitor research in Germany is still marginalized. Furthermore,
Gable (2010) describes how socio-cultural anthropologists increasingly study museums at
home, which is in my case Germany. Thus I want to briefly illuminate the German context of
my visitor research.
In Germany in 2012, the project Knowledge & Museum presented its results at the conference
“Präsenz – ausstellen, erfahren, erforschen” (“Presence – Exhibiting, Experiencing,
Researching”) and with the exhibition “1912 – Ein Jahr im Archiv” (“1912 – One Year in the
Archive”). At the same time the “Zeitschrift für Ethnologie” (German “Journal of Cultural
Anthropology”) presented reviews of ethnographic exhibitions or exhibitions with
anthropological issues by socio-cultural anthropologists for the very first time. The editor of
the “Zeitschrift für Ethnologie”, Markus Schindlbeck, introduced this new section with a
reference to the relevance of such reviews made by experts and marked this with the recent
changes from regional-oriented to issue-oriented exhibitions and from exhibits as main actors
to exhibits as requisites (Schindlbeck 2012: 239-240).
If it is time for exhibition reviews by anthropologists, it should also be time for
anthropological (museum visitor) research in such exhibitions. If it is time to introduce
reviews of anthropological or ethnographic exhibitions, it should also be time for introducing
new methods in anthropological (museum visitor) research like MET, too. If there are new
times of presentation in such exhibitions, there are new times of presenting anthropological
research in academy as well as in museums like additional MET video examples on a DVD.

2

Anthropological or ethnographic exhibitions are important to the field of anthropological
public relations, especially for novices. It should be the main aim to create such exhibitions
carefully for visitor needs, characteristics, interests and behaviour (of movement and use of
digital guides). Hence it should be the main aim to transform anthropological knowledge of
the world into incorporated knowledge at home in Germany. Like the Linden-Museum (2009)
once mentioned on its website: World tours start at home.
If world tours start at home, then what about anthropologists conducting (museum visitor)
research also at home in Germany? What about those conducting research at home in German
literature museums, or at home in German ethnographic museums? What about the world
beyond Europe?
In 2012 at home in Germany, a new ethnographic museum was planned to open in Berlin: the
Humboldt Forum. The ethnographic museum shall move from Dahlem into the middle of the
city next to the Museumsinsel. The Humboldt-Forum does not want to be a classical
ethnographic museum. It comprises space for and exchange between the academy, the library
and the museum (Humboldtforum 2015). This shows an altered awareness of the potential
impact of ethnographic museums and their messages in Germany.
In 2012 at home in Germany, the municipal ethnographic museum of Cologne, called the
Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum – Cultures of the World, was awarded with the museum award
of the European Council for “their innovative concept and their cross-cultural approach”
(personal communication with Klaus Schneider, director of the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum
on 19th October 2015).
If new ethnographic museums can have an important impact in our society, then new
anthropological (museum visitor) research may certainly have an impact, too. And from the
new anthropological reviews of ethnographic exhibitions to the new ethnographic museums
and innovative research: if the academy is focusing on museums again, then we should also
focus on the museum visitors. Even in cross-cultural studies worldwide we should be doing
this.
This research is situated in this broader context of changes in German museums and German
museum studies as well as my personal interest in making (ethnographic) exhibitions in
Germany more suitable for their visitors.

1.2. Main Methods in Visitor Studies and Socio-Cultural Anthropology
Currently what are the traditional, mainly applied methods of visitor research and sociocultural anthropology? In a German introductory book on methods in anthropological
fieldwork Bettina Beer (2003) characterizes anthropological research as being conducted in a
field and does not perform studies in a laboratory that are conducted by applying purposefully
a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods. Several authors present methods such as
participant and systematic observation, linguistic analyses, different kinds of interviews and
questionnaires, the extended-case method, cognitive field tests, ethno-demographic methods,
photography, video and documentation. These are probably the most often applied methods in
anthropological research with participant observation established by Malinowski (1922) being
the most famous one among them.
To properly conduct visitor studies we firstly have to distinguish evaluation from research.
Evaluation is conducted for a single institution or project and can be differentiated as frontend (before producing an exhibition), formative (while in production) and summative (after
the production of an exhibition) evaluation. Whereas research on visitor studies means rather
basic research that provides new transferable insights and generalizable results that are
publicly available (Bitgood & Shettel 1996).
Nevertheless although one might want to distinguish between research and evaluation, both
approaches apply the same methods (Bitgood & Shettel 1996). These methods comprise
mainly three forms: interviews, questionnaires and observation. These methods can be applied
quantitatively or qualitatively. In their summary of visitor study’s methodology, Yalowitz and
Bronnenkant (2009) express the dominant view when they stress that the main method
regarding visitor studies is still observation, no matter how observation data are collected
(e.g., by the paper-and-pencil technique or through videotaping or other tracking
technologies). This principle probably applies to social research more generally since many
social scientists, especially anthropologists, who are conducting field research all over the
world continue to apply the paper-and-pencil technique for observation in the field.
Typically, visitors’ behaviour is investigated by “timing and tracking” studies (Yalowitz and
Bronnenkant 2009). In these studies, trained observers unobtrusively watch visitors make
their way through an exhibition and record which elements they stop at and for how long.
More advanced methods have introduced automatic user tracking, partly combined with
continuous recording of physiological measures such as skin conductance and heart rate in
order to determine the intensity of emotional and cognitive reactions across an exhibition
4

(Tröndle, Greenwood, Kirchberg & Tschacher 2014). My research as well as research by
Tröndle et al. (2014) demonstrate the current trend of an integrative methodology or multiangulation of methods in visitor studies.
The application of these methods in visitor studies shifted from formerly behaviouristic
studies into current constructivist studies acknowledging that visitors are actively engaged in
constructing meaning, hence learning. This approach requires more elaborate research
strategies as well as spending more time and money on research and it gives preference to
social scientists like socio-cultural anthropologists to study museum visitors (HooperGreenhill 2006). Hooper-Greenhill (2006: 374) highlights the work of the social
anthropologists Macdonald and Katriel as examples of research that is aiming at “deep
understanding rather than the improvement of practice”. This characterization also describes
my research agenda, which is detailed below.
In sum, museums can act as a novel field of study for anthropological research that seeks the
field instead of the laboratory, pursues deep understanding and engages in long-term research.
Visitor studies can benefit from anthropological approaches, methods and theories just as
anthropology might benefit from having new methods like MET applied to visitor studies.

1.3. (Mobile Eye) Tracking Studies
Yalowitz and Bronnenkant (2009) provide an excellent overview about tracking studies in
museums but they do not mention MET technology. A famous study by Tröndle et al. (2014)
applied body tracking to investigation the locomotion or circulation of people through a
gallery. However their study does not document the exact eye movements. Milekic (2010)
was one of the first authors who claimed that “eye- and gaze-tracking technologies have
matured enough to be considered for use in a physical museum/gallery setting” and that “eyetracking technologies can play a vital role in museum studies”. Nevertheless few papers have
been published on this new method as it can be applied in visitor studies (Mayr, Knipfer &
Wessel 2009; Filippini-Fantoni, Jaebker, Bauer & Stofer 2013; Krukar & Conroy Dalton
2013; Krukar 2014).
What can we learn from new methods like MET? Mayr et al. (2009) conducted the first
exploratory MET study in “a small exhibition about nanotechnology” (191-192) that had been
created solely for this study at the Knowledge Media Research Centre (KMRC).

5

Before summarizing the results of Mayr et al. (2009) and my own experience, I will provide
some background information about MET because this method might be unknown to most
readers:
As a first step towards understanding MET technology and the kind of data that it provides,
some background knowledge about visual perception in action is essential. The way we
perceive everything visually differs depending on the context, for instance the physical world
appears differently when seated in an armchair reading a book or when sitting in front of a
screen watching videos or looking at images. Seeing the world while being engaged in bodily
action involves more parts of the brain than seeing them while at rest does. These processes
are connected especially to the executive areas of our working memory (Baddeley 2007) and
to our procedural long-term memory (Land & Tatler 2009).
According to Land and Tatler (2009: 221-223 & 4-5), four different neurocognitive systems
are involved:
- The visual system processes bottom-up information about the environment;
- The motor system executes actions within this environment;
- The gaze system decides which information is important or needed for the task;
- The scheme control system applies top-down agendas of where to look, what to look for and
what to do.
The perception of museum visitors is therefore a clear case of what is now called embodied
knowledge in anthropology (Scheper-Hughes 1994, see Chapter 2).
The implicit or procedural knowledge involved in visual perception in action is stored in
schemata and scripts and it is largely unconscious in nature so that agents themselves find it
hard to verbalize and manipulate their behaviour (Land & Tatler 2009; Schank & Abelson
1977 for “scripts”).
The discussion of visual perception relies on three important technical terms which are also
important for our assessment of MET, namely "fixations", "saccades" and "scan patterns".
Our vision consists of so-called eye movement patterns (or scan patterns/gaze patterns) that
are made up of combined “saccade and fixate” strategies. Fixations are very short “stops” of
eye-movements. The duration ranges from 150 ms to 600 ms (Duchowski 2003: 49)
indicating what someone is probably (but not certainly) paying attention to. Saccades are very
rapid eye-movements that occur between fixations spontaneously and can vary in duration
6

from 10 ms to 100ms (Duchowski 2003: 44). When performing saccadic movements we can
hardly perceive anything; we are basically “blind”. Hence, eye-movements are not performed
smoothly but in an apparently zigzag fashion that seems to be very unsystematic at first (Land
& Tatler 2009). Eye-tracking technology records these movements; it is the first task of MET
data analysis to distinguish fixations from saccades and then to investigate correlations
between the observed patterns, meanings and goals of attention (Holmqvist, Nyström,
Andersson, Dewhurst, Jarodzka & Weijer 2011).
Whereas stationary eye-trackers require participants to be seated in front of a screen, METs
can be mounted on the participant’s head while they move around, freely engaging in various
tasks. There are a number of head mounted eye-tracking devices available. We have used the
ASL MobileEye (2006 model) at the Linden-Museum (see below, Figure 1 and 2) and the
Locarna PT Mini (2010 model) at the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach a. N. (see
Chapter 6, Tables 67 and 68). Many of the following points refer to MET technology in
general, although many new technical developments have occurred in the meantime.

7

Figure 2: The ASL MobileEye designed in 2004 and applied 2010 at the Linden-Museum in
Stuttgart (photograph by Kira Eghbal-Azar with kind permission from the Linden-Museum in
Stuttgart)
All of these devices generally work with two cameras (see Figure 1): a scene camera records
the scene and the environment from the participant’s perspective, and an eye-camera records
his or her eye movements usually by using a harmless infrared light, a technique called “dark
pupil tracking”. The two cameras are mounted on frames of a pair of eyeglasses, but most
devices only record one eye of the participant. These glasses sometimes are mounted on a cap
or even on a helmet. As Figure 1 and Figure 22 show, some devices needed to be fixed in a
very stable manner on the participant’s head. However, the current trend is to produce MET
devices that are worn like regular glasses by the participant and that can track both eyes (socalled binocular eye-tracking). These devices reduce the parallax error caused by our
binocular vision, which is more pronounced when relying on MET technology that tracks
only one eye, as advertised by SensorMotoric Instruments and Tobii on their websites in 2015
(SensoMotoric Instruments 2015, Tobii 2015, Holmqvist et al. 2011: 60 for parallax error).
Both separately recorded videos have to be brought together and processed into a single video
by a computer, whereas the calibration of the cameras is essential. Accordingly, selfcalibrating or

2

8

calibration free eye trackers have become another trend in MET technology (Duchowski
2003: 227). Processing3 synchronizes the two recordings so that we receive a single video
with a marker (a fixation cross or circle) that is permanently shown while we watch the
recorded scene from the participant’s perspective. This video indicates eye-movements in
action by using the eye camera together with the picture of the three-dimensional space
through which the participant is moving (Mayr et al. 2009 and the manuals of MET devices:
ASL MobileEye 2006 and Locarna 2010). This process makes MET rather complex to use in
field research, and some preparatory training with this technology is necessary (Holmqvist et
al. 2011: v-vi, 1). Holmqvist et al. (2011) provide the first guide available for eye-tracking
beginners. It provides comprehensive information collected over many years and across many
eye-tracking studies but with the clear focus on remote (stationary) eye tracking for
experimental lab conditions.
One of the reasons eye tracking has not yet played a role in the social sciences is that in its
stationary version it requires a typical experiment-like setting, cutting out the social context
and the context of agency. With MET becoming more readily available this limitation is less
severe today.
Although MET devices have been commercially available since the 1980s, they did not
become realistic to study people “outside the laboratory” until a decade later. While remote
eye tracking in labs is still favoured (Land & Tatler 2009: vii & 9) “the role of vision during
action can usefully be studied only during the performance of action itself, preferably in
conditions that are as unconstrained as possible” (Land & Tatler 2009: vii-viii). As mentioned
above, visual perception in action works differently than sedentary studies performed in front
of computer screens. So far, MET has been commonly applied in research conducted by
biologists, psycholinguists, psychologists and cognitive scientists (Land & Tatler 2009) and is
only rarely used for examining visitors’ eye movement behaviour. With MET we can “grasp
the (visitor’s or) native’s point of view, his relation to life, to realize his vision of his world”
(Malinowski 1922: 25, emphasis in original, brackets by the author) in its very literal sense.
To grasp the meaning of this emic view we have to combine other methods like cued
retrospective reporting. Thus MET can work as a complementary method to other approaches

3

Earlier on data analysis only could be done after synchronizing the videos; currently data analysis is even

possible online while recording takes places (for example Pfleger Vision MET model in 2015).

9

and, when used in this way, it can be appropriate for socio-cultural anthropologists who are
conducting field research to use.

1.4. Museum Visitors’ Movement Behaviour
Immediately following the “turn to the visitor” in museums (Hooper-Greenhill 2006: 362),
visitor behaviour became defined as a process of actively engaged in meaning-making, hence
learning (Falk & Dierking 2013). The initial prerequisite step to make meaning out of
exhibitions is to move through them. How do visitors move around in exhibitions? A
considerable amount of empirical research about visitors’ movement patterns in and
circulation through exhibitions has been carried out since the beginning of tracking studies;
however without applying MET.
To date, visitor research has introduced a distinction between the attracting power of an
exhibit – defined as the number of visitors who notice it, approach it and stop in front of it –
and the holding power of the exhibit – defined as the mean time spent in front of the
respective exhibit. Accordingly, researchers generally assume that a longer holding power
indicates a more elaborate processing of the exhibit (Robinson 1928; Boisvert & Slez 1995;
Serrell 1998).
Further research results about visitor circulation in exhibitions are partially contradictory:
Some studies suggest that the disparities between research studies of different exhibitions may
be attributed either to the design factors of the exhibitions, or to visitor characteristics.
However, they may be attributed to the interaction of design factors and visitor characteristics.
Hence the visitors’ own agenda plays a crucial role (see Falk, Moussouri & Coulson 1998).
Visitor behaviour has been characterized as “free-choice” (Falk & Dierking 2002; Kirchberg
& Tröndle 2012), and accordingly, most visitors do not “work through” an exhibition in a
comprehensive manner but instead focus on a small subset of exhibits.
By observing visitors in a British Science and Industry Museum, Morris Hargreaves McIntyre
(2004) identified four different types of visitor behaviours, which differ both in completeness
and elaborateness of the visit: browsers, followers, searchers and researchers. In short,
browsers browse through the gallery with “little or no agenda” and want information about
selected objects; followers want the museum to provide a narration that they can follow;
searchers already have knowledge about the exhibition theme and want to view all of it; and
researchers are the experts. In this line from browsers to researchers each type of visitor can
10

change into the next type (e.g., browsers can become followers and so on) and the proportion
of these types concerning the whole population is diminishing.
According to Morris Hargreaves McIntyre (2004) going through an exhibition in a systematic
approach means paying attention to nearly all of the exhibits presented. This attentiveness was
observed for less than 10% of the visitors, whereas the vast majority showed a much more
selective behaviour. Similar results have also been reported by Serrell (1997): In several
observation studies in museums and galleries, she found that only a minority of visitors are
“diligent visitors” who stop at more than half of the available exhibits. Instead, museum
visitors showed a highly selective pattern of attention, stopping at only a fraction of all
exhibits, and closely inspecting an even smaller number of them. Thus most visitors only
spend about 20 minutes in one exhibition.
Additionally, it has been shown that during the course of an exhibition, visitors tend to be
increasingly selective and, at the same time, less involved with the exhibition’s content. This
phenomenon has been described as museum fatigue and is experienced by museum visitors
after only 20-30 min. (Bitgood 2009, Davey 2005).
Regarding these findings visitor researchers asked which strategies lead to such behaviour.
Falk & Dierking (2000: 117) conclude that visitors or at least most of them are applying
“poorly developed” strategies of appropriating exhibitions properly. In contrast, the
interaction approach represented mainly by the American psychologist Bitgood and the
American cultural anthropologist Rounds conclude that visitors use appropriate strategies
regarding an exhibition visit. Bitgood and Rounds apply principles or rules derived from the
Rational Choice Theory (RCT) on visitor movements/circulation.
Bitgood (2006; 2013) applies the General Value Principle derived from RCT in visitor
circulation through exhibitions. Thereby the value of an exhibition visit is the result of an
unconscious choice between its benefits and its costs (the General Value formula:
benefits/costs = value). Therefore, visitor circulation is characterized by the “economy of
movement” which means minimizing or ‘saving’ steps in order to save time and physical
energy hence minimizing the costs. Accordingly, visitors tend to pay attention to only one
side of a gallery and also tend to walk along the main track, avoiding aisles and backtrack.
Exceptions are attributed to other motivations like following a group, landmark objects that
trigger more attention, high-interest versus low-interest topics and crowding (i.e., too many
people at one place that visitors want to avoid).

11

Similarly the American anthropologist Jay Rounds (2004) deduces behavioural rules from a
special case of RCT namely Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) as well as from Decision Theory
(DT) and Information Foraging Theory (IFT). Derived from these three theories the following
formula is applied to exhibition visits: the lower the costs of the exhibit search, the greater the
benefits of the exhibition visit wherein exhibits of interest are like food for the hunter- and
gatherer-visitors. From DT, Rounds deduces the landscape analogy and defines the exhibition
landscape as the “interest landscape” of the hunter-and gatherer-exhibition- visitor. This
“interest landscape” has two axes: the horizontal and the vertical axis. The horizontal axis
arisen from the arrangement of exhibits whereas the vertical axis arises from the individual
interest of the visitor in a single exhibit. Hence the exhibition visit is characterized by the
interaction between those two. That is why it is so difficult to arrange exhibits in an equally
interesting way for all visitors.
Rounds (2004) defines his rules as being non-explicit, unconscious and hardly communicable
by the visitor but rather as being rules in the sense of scripts and schemas. He stresses that
they are not specific to the exhibition context but rather are learned in other landscapes that
are similar to exhibitions. He declares that these rules are applied as an interaction between
the changing environment and changing individual needs.
Rounds classifies his behavioural rules as three types: search rules, attention rules and quitting
rules. Search rules are defined as an “initial scanning mechanism” (2004: 401), attention rules
are defined as a “stop searching (for the moment) and start attending” (2004: 403) and
quitting rules are defined as a “stop attending to a given exhibit element and resume the
search” (2004: 405). Unfortunately these rules are not yet empirically proven. Note that I also
do not test Rounds rules in detail, just as I did not analyse complete tours through exhibitions.
However Rounds states that, in order to prove these rules, the complete visit/the complete
circulation within an exhibition must be examined. These rules are difficult to operationalize;
for example, the search rule “Follow your nose” means “If it smells good, check it out. If it
doesn‘t, keep moving” (Rounds 2004: 404). How could this rule be operationalized?
Furthermore, proving these rules are accurate would additionally require methods that elicit
unconscious behaviour.
Rounds (2004: 394) thinks that applying these rules is the appropriate strategy for “wide but
shallow” learning that is experienced in museums rather than “narrow but deep” learning
experienced in school (more about the museum as a learning environment in Chapter 2).

12

In sum, the interaction approach by Bitgood (2006) and Rounds (2004) states that, since
visitors do not have control over the benefits offered in exhibitions (i.e., the design of the
exhibition and the level of information provided), they concentrate on their “costs” in order to
arrive at an optimal visit.
I want to shed light on some critical aspects of this approach. In particular, ‘saving steps’ as a
principle does not explain every phenomenon encountered in exhibitions. Moreover, it does
not account for the most important and distinguishing feature that characterizes a museum
exhibition visit in contrast with other forms of information gathering, like watching a movie
or reading a book: “strolling and viewing” is the classical way of appropriating exhibitions
(“gehen und sehen” Korff & Thiemeyer 2008: 137, cf. Korff 2003). “Strolling and viewing” is
the ability to go off and to explore in multiple possible ways and from a number of
perspectives. This approach is what makes museum exhibition visits such unique experiences
and it is arguably the feature that attracts visitors to museums over other forms of mass media.
The agendas that we have set for ourselves during a visit influence our attention (Falk,
Moussouri & Coulson 1998) and may override the time that we devote to a particular object
as well as the “cost” factor more generally. Alternative explanations of visitor behaviour will
have a better basis for discussion after good data is collected on the time spent on particular
objects, the fixations associated with an exhibition visit and data from other sources, which
together allow for a triangulation of methods as George E. Hein (1998) proposed long ago.
That is why, in my study, I triangulate MET with cued retrospective reporting and systematic
observation.
Furthermore, the definition of value as serving interests and curiosity necessarily leads to
differences between different visitor groups; for example experts and novices probably have
different interests and motivations when they view an exhibition. Thus experts and novices
probably have different agendas when visiting these museum exhibitions. Moreover, defining
value in this way precludes other values, such as the social acts of exhibition visits for
example when visitors discuss objects and issues amongst each other.
The attribution of exceptions on landmark objects or high-interest versus low-interest topics
also neglects differences between different visitor groups as well as between exhibition
makers and visitors. The curatorial agency is insufficiently considered at all, and probably is
also hardly verbalizable by the curators themselves sometimes.
Last but not least, the “General Value Principle” in particular and hence RCT in general is not
falsifiable because everything can be subsumed under costs and benefits. The

critical
13

rationalisms by Popper declared that verification does not exist at all and only falsifiability
counts (Popper 2007). Thus what is the rationale or insight value of a theory that is not
falsifiable?
Furthermore, as a socio-cultural anthropologist, I must criticize Bitgood and the research he is
summarizing as being focused on Anglo-Saxon exhibition and visitor cultures. I mistrust these
research results and Bitgood’s explanations as well as Rounds’ deduced behavioural rules; I
doubt that they are universally applicable to all museum visitors on this planet. What about
people having a geo-centric perception of their environment instead of our ego-centric one?
This critique applies to my own research too, and my results (see below) have to be re-tested
in other cultural settings as well.
Nevertheless what we can learn from the interaction approach is that orientation plays a
crucial role in visitor movement through exhibitions. For example, orientation plays a major
role for Rounds’ search rule and for the saving steps principle stated by Bitgood. No wonder
orientation is a basic need prior to and serving the physiological needs of human beings
(Maslow 1954). It will be interesting to discover how and how often visitors apply movement
patterns for orientation in exhibitions.
In sum, since decisions for movement patterns are unconscious and hardly communicable an
empirical test is difficult. Hence research on movement patterns using MET combined with
cued retrospective reporting is probably the best available method for recording unconscious
reasons for movement behaviour with the cue of one’s own viewing behaviour.

1.5. Digital Guides in Museum Exhibitions
So far, we have concentrated on general visitor behaviour without considering the use of
digital media/guides. Without using digital guides, the movement behaviours in exhibitions
usually require less eye-hand-coordination, whereas digital guides require more eye-hand
coordination. Thus using digital guides presumably must influence the movement behaviour
of visitors. Building on this fundamental concept, I will describe the state of art surrounding
digital guides in museums exhibitions in this section and analyse the movement behaviour
influenced by using digital guides in Chapters 5 and 6.
Since Bourdieu, Darbel & Schnapper’s comparative studies presented in The Love of Art
(1969/1997), museums are defined as mass media themselves. However this thesis does not
focus on museums as mass media. It rather focuses on digital media applied in museums.
14

Media in museums can comprise labels, text panels, dioramas, hands-on exhibits, and new
digital guides etc. In the last two decades, various types of digital guides have gradually
supplemented museum tours, and been offered by museum staff and human interpreters. Such
digital guides come in many forms, ranging from traditional audio guides that provide
explanations in purely oral form (and are widely handed over by museums and already
expected by the visitors) to multimedia presentations on smartphones or tablets that include
both oral and written text, pictures and videos (Proctor 2011, Tallon & Walker 2008, Tallon
2006).
According to Tallon & Walker (2008: xviii) these new digital guides are defined by three
characteristics: they are “mobile” (accessible at any place and any time), “digital” (electricalbased) and “personal” (controlled by the visitor in her/his unique connection with the guide).
Nevertheless, there is no consistent conception of whether these digital guides applied in
museums are exhibits themselves or not (Kirchberg 2006). Sometimes digital guides solely
provide information, sometimes they are part of the exhibition design and sometimes they
become exhibits themselves (Noschka-Roos 2006).
Given the variety of digital guides and despite the huge application of audio guides, hardly
any available research about digital guides exists so far. Tallon (2006) attributes this fact to
the economic reasons of the companies producing the guides and to many prejudices about
digital guides in museums. These prejudices range from audio guides leading to zombie-like
behaviour to preventing the aesthetical experiences that traditional ideology imagines
museums to provide (Tallon & Walker 2008 quotes Alfred Hickling “Block Beuys”,
Guardian, November 29, 2004). That is why basic research about visitor experiences with
digital guides has begun only recently. For example, one study by Eghbal-Azar, Merkt,
Bahnmueller & Schwan (2016) used statistical methods to examine the anonymous user data
recorded by the content management system of the multimedia guide ‘M3’ in the “nexus”
exhibition at the LiMo. They assessed which characteristics are influential in exhibit selection
within the ‘M3’ (for more information read Chapter 6). Until research like this, research
solely focused on percentage of usage of provided digital guides and time spent in exhibition
(Tallon & Walker 2008, Falk & Dierking 2008).
Despite the prejudices articulated by art critics and the press, mobile museum guides offer
several desirable features from the perspective of the visitor. Most importantly, they allow
customization of information and explanation according to the individual needs of the visitor.
Customizable options include selection of language, mode of presentation for people with
15

seeing or hearing disabilities, provision of orienting maps and navigation help, display of
relevant additional material for scrutinizing and in-depth exploration as well as provision of
games and simulations to increase interest and motivation (Proctor 2011, Tallon & Walker
2008).
However, these desirable features of mobile museum guides can also challenge visitors. In
addition to “museum fatigue”, “technology fatigue” is a great issue due to several usability
difficulties like multimedia guides being too heavy, interfaces being too difficult to handle or
audio guides feeling uncomfortable around the visitor’s neck. In the end both types of fatigue
can merge into a special kind of cognitive overload due to too much information provided by
the mobile museum guide (Filippini-Fantoni & Bowen 2008).
Relevant preliminary findings about tablets are currently scarce and more is known about the
well-established audio guides. Smith & Tinio (2008) found that visitors seek a balance
between guidance and freedom in audio tours regarding art exhibitions; howsoever these
audio tours are provided technically. They stated that visitors usually listen to the complete
audio guide spot. Therefore, I assume that the length of an audio guide spot probably
correlates with the dwell time at an audio guide spot. Furthermore they state that audio guide
usage is characterized by the possibility to view the exhibits and listen to the audio guide at
the same time whereas otherwise the attention is separated between exhibits and label.
Bitgood (2010) also stresses this parallel way of appropriating by looking at an exhibit and
listening to the audio guide at the same time as the main advantage of audio guides that do not
shift attention by coupling the gaze.
How is this coupled gaze guided? Franklin, Becklen & Doyle (1993) report on the impact of
different information provided for exhibits. They conclude that it leads to different cognitive
processing but not to different guidance of viewing behaviour.
What about other digital guides like multimedia guides in the form of PDAs, tablets, IPhone,
etc? Do they separate again between viewing exhibits and the multimedia guide? As Tallon
(2006) adds for consideration label reading also interrupts viewing the exhibit. FilippiniFantoni & Bowen (2008) summarize research about these new digital technologies, which
finds evidence for both focusing on the screen instead of the exhibit and processing the
exhibits more elaborately. Furthermore Schwan, Zahn, Wessel, Huff, Herrmann, & Reussner
(2008) found that the design of displays influences the learning outcomes in exhibitions and
digital guides like tablets can lead to more intense involvement with the exhibition’s content.

16

In sum, so far several studies and evaluations have demonstrated that the use of mobile guides
substantially prolonged visitors’ stay in the exhibition by increasing exhibits’ attraction power
(i.e., more visitors paying attention to the exhibits covered by the mobile guide) and holding
power (i.e., visitors spending more time in front of exhibits covered by the mobile guide)
(Kuflik, Stock, Zancanaro, Gorfinkel, Jbara, Kats, Sheidin & Kashtan 2011; Lanir, Kuflik,
Dim, Wecker & Stock 2013). In addition, visitors using mobile guides not only frequently
reported higher satisfaction with the exhibition, but also indicated they noticed details that are
more relevant and developed a better understanding of the exhibits (Belotti, Berta, De Gloria
& Margarone 2002, Helal, Maxson & Ancelet 2013, Kuflik et al. 2011, Mann & Tung 2015,
Webb & Mann 2014, Viehöver 2006).
While ‘holding power’ allows for a crude estimate of elaboration, some observation schemas
make finer differentiations with regard to visitors’ behaviour in the face of a particular exhibit
(Boisvert & Slez 1995, van Schijndel, Franse & Raijmakers, 2010). For example, in the
context of science museums, Boisvert and Slez (1995) distinguish between (i) involved time
when the visitor stands in front of an exhibit but does not read directions or interact with it,
(ii) positive interaction when the user reads labels or uses an exhibit in a way it is intended to
be used, and (iii) instructional time when a visitor has an exhibit explained or discusses the
meaning of an exhibit. Thus, according to Boisvert and Slez (1995), looking at an exhibit
involves several steps that increase cognitive elaboration, with prior steps being necessary
conditions for the following ones, and with the possibility of stopping at every point during
the process. Hence, it is only on the third level of Boisvert and Slez’s taxonomy that a visitor
may decide to access additional information via digital guide.
What exactly happens on this third level? Regarding the variety of technologies, their
prototypical existence and the few studies so far, it is hardly possible to find or conclude
generalizable research findings overall or regarding ethnographic or literature exhibitions in
particular. Unsurprisingly, to the knowledge of this author, no visitor study so far has
investigated the influence of digital guides on eye movement behaviours and accompanying
cognitive processes. Hence this thesis is presenting the latest state of art.

1.6. Research Questions, Aims, Applied Methods and Outline
This chapter described (my) reasons for studying visitors as a socio-cultural anthropologist,
the main methods in visitor studies and socio-cultural anthropology and the results

of visitor

studies, namely the visitors’ movement behaviour and their usage of digital

media.
17

Throughout this chapter, it should be clear that we already know a lot about visitor movement
circulation through a gallery on the macro-level, but less about smaller eye movements on the
micro level. How do eyes move around in exhibitions? What movements of the head, the
trunk and the whole body do they entail? The answers to these questions will be provided in
Chapters 4 to 6, whereas a complete list of all movement patterns identified by this research
will be provided in Chapter 8 in Table 17 paragraph 8.2.1. Visitors’ Movement Patterns: The
Complete Master List.
Furthermore, we know very little about the use of digital guides in exhibitions, and even less
about how they influence visitors’ movements and cognitive processing. How does the usage
of digital guides influence movement behaviours and cognitive processing? Do different
digital guides like audio guides and tablets influence the visitors’ behaviours and cognitive
processing differently? The answers to these questions will be provided in Chapter 5 (audio
guide) and Chapter 6 (tablet-like guide).
As Hooper-Greenhill (1994: 69) already correctly stated “Research and evaluation are often
confused”. Accordingly, I must clarify that the visitor studies presented in this thesis belong
to basic research providing new insights into visitor movement patterns and use of digital
guides that are transferable between different kinds of exhibitions rather than to the evaluation
or assessment of the presented exhibitions. Hence the objective of this thesis is not to evaluate
whether the visitors ‘got the message’ of the exhibitions, although I will provide some
incidental hints about this later. Additionally the objective of this thesis is not to evaluate the
digital guides provided in these exhibitions, although I will provide some incidental hints
about this as well. The objective is to provide a detailed description of movement patterns and
the associated cognitive processes as well as the use of digital guides. Through these
descriptions, this thesis will provide new innovative results about museum visitor behaviours
on the micro-level of eye movements thus filling the gaps in the current literature. In the end,
building on this empirical basis, design suggestions are presented for creating visitor-centred
exhibitions in hopes that exhibition makers can gain useful information about which design
option they want to choose.
Therefore this thesis has several aims led by a new cognitive science approach in visitor
studies that combines anthropological and psychological theories and methods:
1. Chapter 2 aims to introduce three main concepts and terms: firstly, the “concept of
affordance” by Gibson (1979); secondly, the latest notion of appropriation of
museums by visitors; and thirdly, the widely applied term of museum experience.
18

These three concepts and terms shall help to understand the results of this research and
contextualize them within the latest theoretical concepts. Furthermore the field of the
respective museums and their exhibitions, namely ethnographic and literature
museums, will be introduced in general.
2. Chapter 3 aims to describe the research fields. It provides a detailed description of the
two exhibitions “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” at the
Linden-Museum in Stuttgart and the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo in Marbach a. N.
through floor plans, laying lists, photographs of each exhibit and original texts of the
exhibition and their guides. These descriptions provide bases for the reader to
contextualize the results within their research setting and transfer the results to other
exhibitions.
3. Chapter 4 investigates distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns due to
particular “affordances” (Gibson 1979) in the exhibition design or the exhibit
characteristics that are identified in the first study in the “South Sea Oasis: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart.
Therefore the recent method of MET will be applied and combined with cued
retrospective reporting to determine the goal of visitors’ attention and the meaning of
the movement patterns without focusing on learning outcomes but instead focusing on
learning processes. A minor aim was to investigate the differences between experts
and novices.
4. Chapter 5 validates the identified movement patterns found in the first MET study by
applying a completely different method, namely systematic observation, to study the
same exhibition. This validation is performed to triangulate the study. Another
substantial aim is to analyse the influence of digital media on these movement
patterns. In this case the digital medium is an audio guide in the “South Sea Oases:
Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition. According to Tallon (2006: 5)
future research about audio guide should investigate whether “audio tours allow the
viewer to be active”. Hence, I will analyse carefully whether audio guide usage leads
to more active behaviours in the sense of more quantitatively performed eye
movements that can be identified.
5. Chapter 6 uses MET to validate the movement patterns found at the Linden-Museum
in Stuttgart exhibition in a second, different exhibition – the literature exhibition
“nexus” at the LiMo in Marbach a. N. It investigates whether these patterns are
transferable in a different exhibition setting. In comparison to the influence of audio
19

guides on the distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns, I will also
investigate the influence of the tablet-like multimedia museum guide ‘M3’ in the
“nexus” exhibition at the LiMo with regard to the differences between these two
digital guides. Furthermore, I will look for further distinct, recurrent and systematic
movement patterns that are linked to this different exhibition with its different guide.
Investigating the differences between experts and novices is a minor aim also
discussed in this chapter.
6. Chapter 7 critically reflects on the applied methods concerning their potentials,
limitations and prospects in visitor studies and in socio-cultural anthropology as well
as in regard to the reactions they trigger. Besides MET, cued retrospective reporting
and systematic observation, I wrote field diary notes during the whole research
process; I conducted interviews with the curators and documented the exhibitions. All
methods were connected into a multi-angulation approach. The combination of these
methods is truly a new cognitive science approach in visitor studies and socio-cultural
anthropology requiring more effort of time and money. Thereby I also hope to this
thesis will help anthropologists and other social scientists engaged in field research
make an informed decisions about whether and how to apply MET-technology in their
future research studies.
7. Chapter 8 summarizes the research results; concludes with a discussion about the
application of the theoretical terms “affordance”, appropriation and museum
experience; and presents a master list of all 26 movement patterns that were identified
in both exhibitions. Furthermore it presents conclusions about the influence of digital
guides in exhibitions. This chapter also summarizes design suggestions based on this
visitor research and anticipates the future of digital guides in exhibitions. It anticipates
the future of MET in visitor studies and socio-cultural anthropology, this new
cognitive science approach in visitor studies and future visitor studies.

2. Affordances, Appropriation and Experience in Museum Exhibitions
What theories, concepts and terms could help to investigate these research questions? What is
the field of museum exhibitions? This chapter will introduce the “theory of affordances” by
Gibson (1979) as the main theory that forms the basis of my research questions and aims as
well as the widely applied key terms like ‘museum experience’ and ‘appropriation’ (although
the term appropriation is used here from a visitor perspective rather than from the traditional
museum perspective regarding the objects). Finally, the field sites, museums and museums
exhibitions in general as well as ethnographic and literature museums in particular, will be
introduced in preparation for the detailed description of the two respective exhibitions: the
“South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the LindenMuseum in Stuttgart and the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo in Marbach a. N. presented in
Chapter 3. However, as one chapter is not much for all these issues, this chapter can only give
a flavour of them.

2.1. Affordances in Museum Exhibitions
The term “affordance” is a derivation of the verb “to afford” which means “able to have or
do” and was coined by the ecological psychologist Gibson (1979: 127). Hence, for example a
chair is perceived as to be “sit-on-able” (Gibson 1979: 128). Gibson’s “theory of affordances”
(1979) established a new ecological approach to visual perception at his time. Gibson (1966:
285) defined affordances as “properties of the environment relative to an animal” and thus
affordances lead the behaviour of the animal (Sheehy 2004).
Gibson’s theory of affordances is based on “the foundational Gestalt perceptual principles of
figure/grounds” and “direct perception” (Jenkins 2008: 36) as well as “direct knowing”
(Jenkins 2008: 37). It is derived from the particular concepts of the Gestalt psychologists
Koffka (1935: “demand character”) and Lewin (1969: “invitation character”). Koffka (1935:
7) defines his concept of “demand character” as follows: “Each thing says what it is….a fruit
says ‘Eat me’; water says ‘Drink me’; thunder says ‘Fear me’; and woman says ‘Love me’”.
Furthermore Gibson (1979: 138) summarizes the sentiment as follows: “The postbox ‘invites’
the mailing of a letter”. The concepts of Koffka and Lewin implicate a strong interdependency
or interaction (Jenkins 2008: 36, 38) or “complementarity” (Gibson 1979: 127), “reciprocity”
(Jenkins 2008: 34) or “relationship” (Norman 2013: 11) between the environment and the
21

perceiver. This interdependency was originally defined to be so strong that the character of
environmental objects can change if the needs of the perceiver change. Although Gibson also
takes the interdependency between environment and the perceiver into account, he states that
the character of objects always exists, whether it is perceived or not and even if the temporary
needs of the perceiver change:
“The affordance of something does not change as the need of the
observer changes. The observer may or may not perceive or attend to
the affordance, according to his need, but the affordance, being
invariant, is always there to be perceived. An affordance is not
bestowed upon an object by a need of an observer and his act of
perceiving it. The object offers what it does because it is what it is”
(Gibson 1979: 138-139).
Furthermore Gibson’s theory of affordance does not rely on phenomenology like previous
Gestalt principles:
“For Koffka it was the phenomenal postbox that invited letter-mailing,
not the physical postbox. But this duality is pernicious. I prefer to say
that the real postbox (the only one) affords letter-mailing to a letterwriting human in a community with a postal system” (Gibson 1979:
139).
Thus, Gibson integrates the cultural system as one part of the all-embracing environmental
system and does not separate between nature and culture as he does not separate between
object and subject. Like the Gestalt psychologists he wants to overcome false dichotomies and
perceives them as being polarised (Jenkins 2008: 39), hence according to Gibson (1979: 129):
“An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and
helps us to understand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact of the
environment and a fact of behaviour. It is both physical and psychical,
yet neither. An affordance points both ways, to the environment and to
the observer”.
Hence exhibition visits that are part of our cultural system (at least for some parts of our
society) are also part of the environment. Moreover Gibson (1979: 129) himself compares
architecture with ecology:
22

“In architecture a niche is a place that is suitable for a piece of
statuary, a place into which the object fits. In ecology a niche is a
setting of environmental features that are suitable for an animal, into
which it fits metaphorically”.
Consequently the theory of affordance can be applied to architecture and design. Norman
made “affordances” known for the very first time in the history of design in the first edition of
his book formerly named “The Psychology of Everyday Things” (1988) now renamed “The
Design of Everyday Things” (2013). Norman (2013) wanted to overcome bad or poorly
developed design by understanding human perception and behaviour because he believes that
the users are not to blame. That is why he seeks a human-centred design. Hence the theory of
affordance can be applied in exhibition design and thus visitor studies as well. Gibson (1979:
137) himself even provides examples for design factors:
“Note also that a glass wall affords seeing through but not walking
through, whereas a cloth curtain affords going through but not seeing
through. Architects and designers know such facts, but they lack a
theory of affordances to encompass them in a system”.
By conducting interviews with the curators of the respective exhibitions, I learned that both
curators more or less know about the influence of design factors on visitors’ behaviours but
they lack a comprehensive system of design factors and their affordances. This thesis aims to
provide such an often-lacking conscious system based on the theory of affordances for
exhibition designers and curators. It aims to overcome bad or poorly developed exhibition
design because, as I demonstrated in Chapter 1, the visitors are not to blame. That is why I
seek visitor-centred exhibition design.
Therefore I want to transfer Gibson’s definition of affordances as being “properties taken with
reference to the observer” (1979: 143) into “exhibition design properties with reference to the
visitor” as Chemero (2003: 187) would have put it and introduce some examples of possible
affordances, thus “perceived action possibilities” (Jenkins 2008: 34), in exhibitions.
Starting with Gibson’s examples of a chair and a glass wall, I must note that within an
exhibition chairs have to be differentiated into “exhibited chairs” and “provided (most often
folding) chairs” for visitors. Both types of chairs can be perceived as “sit-on-able” and
therefore “exhibited chairs” are often exhibited behind a string or covered by a sign: “Don’t
touch”. The string/the sign changes the affordances of the exhibited chair. In contrast,
provided chairs are actually meant to be “sit-on-able”. If we combine Gibson’s theory

of
23

affordance with Barker’s (1968) “behaviour setting theory”, it becomes clear that behaviour
onto affordances is context-dependent. Note that Barker’s concept also was based on Gestalt
psychology, as he was a student of Kurt Lewin (Jenkins 2008: 35).
Gibson’s second example, the glass wall, is most common in exhibitions in the form of glassy
display cabinets. As Gibson correctly concludes, visitors do not perceive them as “walkthrough-able”. They are “see-through-able”, although from a defined distance. Do visitors
treat these glass walls as a limitation of perceiving? To what extent do glass walls restrict
movements and for whom? I will show in Chapter 4 that glass walls are not limiting
perceptions but rather lead to more and a broader range of movement patterns especially for
experts.
Norman (2013: 11), who also refers to the glass example, defines the limitation of walking
through glass as an “anti-affordance – the prevention of interaction”. According to Norman,
the glass limitation of movement may not be perceived; hence birds and human beings
sometimes crash into windows and glassy doors. Thus Norman elaborates on the theory of
affordances for designers by introducing a further term: “signifiers”. Signifiers are needed
when affordances are not perceivable. Then signifiers tell us what we can do and where. Thus
the string around or the sign attached to the exhibited chair mentioned above is rather a
signifier.
Furthermore, in regard to exhibitions, we have to differentiate between front-glass display
cabinets that are see-through-able only from one side and display cabinets entirely made of
glass that are see-through-able from all four sides or at least more than one side. Do these
different display cabinets afford different movements? What about glass shelves within such
display cabinets? Which further affordances do they evoke? I will demonstrate in Chapters 4
and 6 and I will summarize in Chapter 8 that there is a difference between front-glass display
cabinets and display cabinets made completely of glass. The action possibilities multiply with
multiple glass walls and shelves.
In contrast to glass walls of display cabinets, some exhibits are presented freestanding without
glass walls around them. Most often these freestanding exhibits are presented behind strings
or on a platform. Presented on a platform exhibits can be approached closer than behind a
glass wall or a string. Which further movements do they afford? What are the differences in
visitor’s movement patterns between display cabinets with glass walls and freestanding
exhibits on platforms? I will demonstrate in Chapter 4 that some movement patterns are only
occurring at freestanding exhibits. In contrast other movement patterns that firstly seem to be
24

characteristic for freestanding are even more often performed at display cabinets due to the
limitation of the glass wall that seems to provide security in movement.
Whether exhibits are presented in display cabinets or freestanding, they can be presented in a
homogenous way with similar kinds of exhibits or in a heterogeneous way with different
kinds of exhibits. How does a homogenous or heterogeneous presentation afford movements?
Are there differences in movement behaviour between these two forms of presentation? I will
demonstrate in Chapter 4 that museum fatigue is a matter of homogenous presentation and
that heterogeneous presentation leads to more active movement behaviour and a deeper level
of cognitive processing.
Whether exhibits are presented in display cabinets or freestanding, they can be presented
hanging or lying. How do lying or hanging exhibits afford movement behaviour or rather
which movement behaviour possibilities do they entail? These questions will be answered in
Chapters 4 to 6. At this point, I want to mention that hanging exhibits lead to one particular
movement pattern that is performed to view the exhibit from different perspectives no matter
if it is put in a display cabinet or freestanding.
Thus, Gibson’s theory of affordances is still up to date in research about visual attention,
although it is from the late 1970s. Duchowski (2003: 6) summarizes Gibson’s work as still
relevant to the design of eye tracking research as Gibson’s work is relevant for the aspect of
“how” to perceive the world. This “how to perceive” the environment is also stressed by
Gibson (1979: 128) himself instead of “where” one lives in the environment.
Although Gibson’s theory of affordances is still considered current, two major critiques have
been offered against it: Firstly, it lacks a clarification of how “direct perception” works
(Jenkins 2008: 37). Secondly, learning is not sufficiently considered (Gibson 1966: 285,
Jenkins 2008: 39). Nevertheless, Gibson’s theory of affordances is striking and innovative
because previous and current psychological theories of information processing lack a
particular psychological explanation of their own that is not borrowed elsewhere like the
computer analogy (Jenkins 2008: 38-40).
Taking Gibson’s theory of affordances into account is not new in visitor studies: Wineman &
Peponis (2010) and Tröndle (2014) applied it. Tröndle (2014: 14) finds evidence “that the
affordance of the museum environment strongly affects visitor movement” through an art
gallery. Thereby “Positioning seems to have more impact than the artist’s reputation or the
image itself” (Tröndle 2014: 13).
25

Nevertheless, these two examples apply affordances differently than I do. Wineman and
Peponis (2010) mentioned the term explicitly in the headline of their article (Constructing
Spatial Meaning: Spatial Affordances in Museum Design) but they neglected to explain the
theory of affordance more deeply and hence missed the chance to appreciate the whole value
of the theory of affordance for visitor movement behaviour. Anyway, their research of
movement behaviour is concerned with the macro-level of circulation or locomotion through
an exhibition rather than on the micro level of eye movements at particular exhibition
sections.
Tröndle (2014) not only mentions the term explicitly in the headline of his article Space,
Movement and Attention: Affordances of the Museum Environment but also explains the
concepts of Lewin (1936), Barker (1968) and Gibson (1979). Like Wineman & Peponis
(2010), he applies these concepts to the macro-level of circulation or locomotion through an
art gallery rather than on the micro level of eye movements at particular exhibition sections.
Furthermore he uses body tracking instead of MET, hence the exact eye movements are
missing. His results rely upon only one single study, which makes it difficult to draw any
generalizations. Finally, yet importantly, my research is based on further theoretical terms
beyond affordances like the terms “appropriation” and “museum experience”.

2.2. Appropriation in Museum Exhibitions
Usually, if one speaks about appropriation concerning museums and especially about
archaeological or ethnographic museums, one speaks of the cultural appropriation of objects
by the museum. Hence, ethical concerns have to be considered carefully (Young & Brunk
2012).
For example, if you conduct a Google search for “appropriation in museums”, you can find
434,000 results and about 42,600 papers and books linked via Google Scholar (received on 07
October 2015). Ordered by impact the very first Google Scholar result is the book Museums
and the Appropriation of Culture edited by Susan Pearce, the Professor Emeritus of Museum
Studies at the University of Leicester, in 1994. Several authors contributed papers to this book
commenting on various aspects of appropriation of culture by museums. In particular, Mary
Beard and John Henderson (1994) comment on the multiple forms of appropriation by the
museum concerning the objects and their histories. Their comments are based on

the
26

exhibition The Exhibition? curated by these two authors themselves. This exhibition calls into
question the appropriation of culture by museums. I chose this article as an example because
the authors work through the term appropriation in their exhibition and thus in their article. In
the end Beard and Henderson (1994: 40) ask “Are visitors passive consumers who put
themselves at the disposal of regimes of display? Do museums occasion particular sets of
cultural behaviour?” However like many others, they do not shed light on the multiple forms
of appropriation of the museum by visitors.
In this thesis, I want to shift our attention to the active appropriation of museums or rather
exhibitions and their exhibits by the visitors. This aspect has been widely neglected so far and
rather seldom considered and defined as a performative act of further appropriation. What do I
mean by appropriation of exhibitions and their objects by visitors? I want to label the “rolling
and strolling” (Korff & Thiemeyer 2008) of visitors through exhibitions and the
accompanying cognitive processes as a kind of further appropriation that is based on the
previous appropriation by the museum. It entails the collecting of objects, the selection for
display in exhibitions and the presentation practice or design of exhibits in exhibitions as
Beard and Henderson (1994) described it. By “rolling and strolling” through exhibitions
visitors are appropriating exhibitions with their entire body (trunk, head and eyes) and person
including their physical, psychological and cognitive knowledge. Anthropology calls this
“embodied knowledge” (Scheper-Hughes 1994) or “embodiment” (Csordas 1990).
In regards to embodiment, we have to refer also to the concept of “habitus” by the French
sociologist and anthropologist Pierre Bourdieu (1977). Originally the term habitus was the
Latin translation by Thomas Aquinas of Aristoteles’ term ‘hexis’ which can be described as a
disposition to a certain activity or character. The term was also applied by Durkheim and is
nephew Mauss (Wacquant 2011).
Bourdieu’s concept of habitus is based on Mauss’ (1973) concept of habitus as illustrated in
his essay Techniques of the Body. According to Mauss, the habitus is learned and differs
“between societies, educations, properties and fashions, prestiges” (1973: 73); hence, habitus
also differs between sex and age (1973: 76-77). Mauss and Bourdieu differentiate between
habit and habitus in similar ways (Crossley 2013). Bourdieu (1977: 218, note 47) thinks of the
“habit as a mechanical assembly or performed programme”. Hence, a habit is “mechanical
behaviour” (Crossley 2013: 139) or rather a “mechanical concept” (Crossley 2013: 140),
whereas the habitus is rather a learned body technique like swimming (Mauss

1973).

27

Furthermore, according to Mauss habit refers to differences between singular persons whereas
the habitus refers to differences between social groups (Crossley 2013).
Hence Bourdieu describes the habitus as a class-specific practice connected to the social sense
(“le sense pratique”) which encompasses all other senses of the body and beyond of the social
agent. Thus, habitus is embodied by the social agent and is complementarily practiced by its
body in the way someone walks or talks (Bourdieu 1977 and 1990; Schwingel 1995/2003).
The habitus is formed by the incorporated or embodied dispositions of perception schemata,
cognition schemata (everyday knowledge, ethos and taste) and behaviour schemata. The agent
is socialized or enculturated in this schemata and the social agent is constantly reproducing by
applying his/her socially learned and determined habitus in his/her social practice (Schwingel
1995/2003). Thus, the habitus is experienced by the social agent as something naturally given
(Bourdieu 1977 and Bourdieu, Darbel & Schnapper 1969/1997). Hence, the habitus and the
social “field” are not taken as dichotomies but as being complementary to each other
(Schwingel 1995/2003) similar to how Gibson and the Gestalt theorists (mentioned above)
consider polarised parts instead of dichotomies concerning the subject and its environment.
However, habitus does not determine the social practice itself but rather the limits of optional
ways of practice. To put it differently, the habitus determines how the social practice is
individually performed. The access to the different forms of “capital”, which are economic,
social, and cultural capital, defines the lived way of social practice. Hence, habitus can
validate itself and the class specific field or transform itself into other kinds of habitus and
hence transform the field as well (Schwingel 1995/2003).
Bourdieu et al. (1969/1997) in The Love of Art present a famous example of the habitus or
more precisely “cultural practice” determined by the access to cultural capital. Bourdieu et al.
(1969/1997) conducted comparative visitor studies in France, Greece, Holland, Poland and
Spain. They conclude that across all these nations higher social classes who already possess
more cultural capital through schooling visit museums more often, despite the fact that they
are public institutions. Like museums, schooling also reproduces the social class inequality in
education, and through the habitus of their social class. Hence, The Love of Art, thus taste, is
learned “by habit and exercise” (Bourdieu et al. 1969/1997: 109) that leads to a second
“cultivated nature” (Bourdieu et al. 1969/1997: 110), hence nurture. Thus museum visitors
usually learn how to move and appropriate through exhibitions “by habit and exercise” of
their higher educated social class.

28

The habitus is automatically performed; normally the habitus is not put into question and is
rather unconscious because it is experienced as something naturally given (Schwingel
1995/2003). As has been mentioned movement patterns are also automatically performed and
are unconscious to the performer. Thus movement patterns can be considered part of a
museum visitor’s habitus and thus as a particular kind of embodied appropriation of
exhibitions. Therefore, future research has to prove whether the movement patterns of visitors
identified in this research are culturally different.
Embodiment is not only considered by social scientists but also by cognitive scientists
(Gallagher 2005, Varela, Thompson & Rosch 1991, Gibbs 2006). According to Gibbs (2006:
1) “Embodiment in the field of cognitive science refers to understanding the role of an agent’s
own body in its everyday, situated cognition”. This current thinking of interdependent mindbody relationship wants to overcome the distinction between body and mind rooted in the
ancient Greek philosophy that is still common in “Western” sciences. The embodiment
approach wants to overcome the stimulus-response theories and stresses the interaction of the
body, the mind and their environment. Hence, perception relates to the actual behaviour while
something is being perceived. This idea is not new. Former leading thinkers include the
philosopher John Dewey in the 19th century and the psychologist James J. Gibson in the 20th
century mentioned above (Gibbs 2006). John Dewey (1896: 137-138) claimed that:
“In a certain sense, it is the movement which is primary, and the
sensation which is secondary, this movement of the body, head, and
eye movements, determining the quality of what is experienced. In
other words, the real beginning is with the act of seeing; it is looking,
and not a sensation of light”.
This qualifies previous statements about eye movements and perception described in Chapter
1. Hence eye movements and cognitive processes about the perceived objects are more
intertwined than previously assumed. Gibbs (2006: 64) puts this more directly: “Object
perception is not an event that happens to us; rather it is something that we do by looking at
the object”. Hence, perception is rather actively conducted by means of eye, head and body
movements. Thus, eye, head and body movements are part of an active appropriation of
exhibitions and exhibits.
In sum, when I say “appropriation of exhibitions by visitors”, I mean the active embodied
appropriation of exhibitions by the visitor who performs particular movement patterns. Thus,
this appropriation mediates between the affordances of exhibitions and the

exhibition
29

experience. This appropriation is connected with the exhibition’s affordances or rather is
based on them and leads to a particular exhibition experience. Hence, my term of
appropriation is complementing the interconnected triad of affordance, experience and
appropriation.
How exactly do museum visitors actively appropriate exhibitions? What kind of movement
patterns do they apply for this active appropriation? Before I present my research results in
Chapter 4, 5 and 6, here some previous classifications of movement patterns by other
scientists shall be introduced as a useful point of departure.
The cultural scientist Aleida Assmann (1995) and the sociologist Heiner Treinen (1988)
already identified two major movement patterns: the “long gaze” (der “lange Blick“) by
Assmann and “cultural window shopping” (“kulturelles window shopping”) by Treinen.
Whereas Aleida Assmann’s term belongs to the general reception of objects in the world,
Heiner Treinen’s term actually refers to museum visitor behaviour. Nevertheless, both terms
belong to the same state of consciousness that characterizes museum visits: aesthetic
contemplation.
Aleida Assmann (1995: 240-242) differentiates between the “quick look” and the “long gaze”.
Assmann bases these two different ways to look at the world upon the idea that the world can
be read as a text. The “quick look” at the world means “reading” the signs of the world and
hence transforming the world into knowledge about the world. The “long gaze” is defined as
staring (“gazing”) contemplatively at the materiality of the world without reading it and hence
without

transforming

it

(into

knowledge).

It

is

characterized

by

“suddenness”

(“Plötzlichkeit”), subjective un-knowing and “ecstasy” (“Ekstase”) (Assmann 1995: 248).
Hence, the “long gaze” can be described as a “fascinated gaze” (“faszinierte(r) Blick”)
(Assmann 1995: 249).
Treinen’s (1988: 33) term of “cultural window shopping” is an exemplary movement pattern
of what he calls “active snoozing” (“aktive(s) Dösen”). According to Treinen (1988: 33), most
museum visitors are looking for amusement (“Zerstreuung”) in museums compared to
watching television. Hence, “active snoozing” lets visitors stroll around exhibitions like they
stroll around towns where they are “Window Shopping” in the malls. It seems the only
difference is the cultural aspect of museums. Visitors consequently do not learn much new
knowledge just by “cultural window shopping” museum; instead they search for the
confirmation of their previous knowledge. Thus, Treinen is critical with the notion of
museums as learning settings.
30

Further movement patterns were already identified by the pioneering exploratory MET study
of Mayr et al. (2009). Firstly, they (2009: 116) already reported behaviour that “serves as
initial selection of information and visual search” and that “During early processing stages,
pictorial information or text is quickly skimmed and scanned, so that a viewer gets the gist of
a scene very quickly”. These eye movements serve to orientate oneself and get an overview of
the display. Secondly, they report on fixations that “alternate” between exhibits (Mayr et al.
2009: 193-194), a phenomenon that I will call “alternating gaze” later.
Thus, these examples of movement patterns “long gaze”, “cultural window shopping”,
“alternating gaze” and gazes for orientation and overview are the starting point of my MET
quest for movement patterns of museum visitors. I will demonstrate in Chapters 4 and 6 that
my MET studies also validate these movement patterns. In sum, the research presented in this
thesis identified 26 movement patterns including these. A complete list of all these movement
patterns is presented in Chapter 8 in Table 17 paragraph 8.2.1. Visitors’ Movement Patterns:
The Complete Master List.
Mayr et al. (2009) conducted their exploratory MET study in “a small exhibition about
nanotechnology” (2009: 191-192), providing “first insights into informal learning in
museums” (Mayr et al. 2009: 195) at the Knowledge Media Research Centre in Tuebingen,
Germany. However, Mayr et al. neglect that visitors are not simply “integrating information
that is spatially distributed” (p. 190) but are engaged in what could be called “appropriating”
the exhibition. Appropriating exhibitions means that visitors are not only gathering
information but also actively looking for an emotional and aesthetic experience (Hein 2000)
in a particular social setting (Falk & Dierking 2013). Now let us have a closer look at visitors’
experiences in museum exhibitions.

2.3. Experience in Museum Exhibitions
First, to speak of “experience” in the context of museum exhibitions should not be taken for
granted. We only recently speak of “museum experience” due to the shift to a constructivist
approach to museums that defines knowledge and truths as always something constructed and
hence revises the museum tasks. One of these revised museum tasks is to provide experiences
for visitors via authentic objects (Hein 2000). Hence, contemporary museums “feature objects
as means to experience rather than as ends in themselves” (Hein 2000: 71) and hence

31

contemporary exhibitions shift “from (exhibiting) objects used as evidence to objects that
evoke experience” (Hein 2000: 79; addition in brackets by the author of this thesis).
Secondly, the museum experience is defined has something all comprising; hence, it is
defined as a “gestalt” (Falk & Dierking 2013: 173-194) and is therefore considered as a
holistic experience. Thus according to Falk & Dierking (2013: 192):
“Many aspects beyond the museum’s exhibitions, programs, and
media influence the visitor’s experience, including parking, restrooms,
shops, and food service. Unlike most museum professionals, visitors
do not view these aspects of the museum as separate functions; the
visitor sees the museum as a seamless whole”.
Furthermore, it is not only reduced to the actual museum visit but it also comprises the time
before and after the visit; hence, the reasons (be)for(e) visiting and the processing of the
experience of the actual visit afterwards belong together (Falk & Dierking 2013). According
to Falk & Dierking (2013: 33), “The Museum Experience can be understood using the
Contextual Model of Learning” that they established in 1992 then called the “Interactive
Experience Model”. The “Contextual Model of Learning” comprises three contexts that are
interconnected with each other over time: (i) the personal context, (ii) the sociocultural
context and the (iii) physical context.
(i)

The personal context entails “prior experiences, interests, knowledge, beliefs and
values” (Falk & Dierking 2013: 33) of the single visitor.

(ii)

The sociocultural context refers to the museum as a “societal institution” (Falk &
Dierking 2013: 33) and the socio-cultural character of a museum visit.

(iii)

The physical context comprises the building, the exhibitions with their exhibits
and the provided information in the form of labels and media, etc.

In sum, “Whatever the visitor does focus on is filtered through the personal context, mediated
by the sociocultural context, and embedded within the physical context” (Falk & Dierking
2013: 30).
Thirdly, one can also define the visitor’s experience in museums as incorporating the
following aspects of experience: (i) learning, (ii) aesthetic, (iii) (more or less) multisensory,
(iv) bodily, (v) emotional, (vi) social and (vii) entertaining. These aspects are not separated
but rather intertwined with each other. For presentation purposes, these aspects are described
32

separately. The descriptions shall only provide a flavour of the several museum experience
aspects; otherwise, the descriptions of these aspects would go beyond the scope of this
chapter.

(i)

Learning experience:

Museums and exhibitions are defined as informal learning settings in contrast to formal
learning settings in schools and universities (Schwan 2015). Thus, Falk & Dierking (2002)
define learning in museums as “free choice” learning that depends on the free will of the
learner in contrast to the will of the teacher; hence, free choice is connected to intrinsic
motivation in contrast to extrinsic motivation. Therefore, Rounds defines learning in museums
as driven by a curiosity that aims at “wide but shallow” learning in contrast to “narrow but
deep” learning in formal learning settings. According to Schwan (2015) the actual learning
situation within an exhibition can be modelled as more or less formal or informal depending
on formalisation factors like visits as part of school groups or as part of guided tours. Hence,
the concrete learning situation in museum exhibition is a rather mixed form depending on the
concrete learning process, setting, aims and content.
How can learning in museums be investigated? Visitor research changed in a similar way to
the change of the psychological definition of learning from result and effects to process
(Schwan 2015). This change is also connected to the shift from behaviouristic visitor research
to constructivist visitor research (Kirchberg 2010). Within this shift, new research methods
are applied like MET combined with verbal reports (Mayr et al. 2009, Eghbal-Azar & Widlok
2013, Filippini-Fantoni et al. 2013).
My research also focuses not on the concrete learning outcomes of the museum visits but
instead on the learning processes that go along with the appropriation of exhibitions and
exhibits by distinct, recurrent and systematic eye, head, trunk and body movements.

(ii)

Aesthetic experience:

Visitor researchers who focus on the learning aspect of the museum experience often tend to
neglect the aesthetic experience of exhibitions that cannot be evaluated in terms of
33

information processing as in Mayr et al. (2009). This has often been criticised by my
colleagues from the Knowledge & Museum project. However, what exactly is an aesthetic
museum experience? The philosopher Hilde Hein (2000: 131) provides a concrete answer:
“The merit of aesthetic experience is that its value is taken to be
intrinsic. It is an end in itself, enjoyable without reference to further
consequences, complete within itself”.
It involves a contemplative state of mind. Art museums are the prototype for such aesthetic
experience but the wave splashed over to other museums and thus not only literature but also
ethnographic museums recently focus on aesthetic experiences although these other museums
provide a different kind of aesthetic experience (Hein 2000). My research does not focus on
aesthetic experiences, although I will present one example in the last chapter.

(iii)

Multisensory experience:

Museum experiences can be multisensory experiences depending on the exhibition design
(Levent & Pascual-Leone 2014). Of course, primarily because we mainly view exhibitions,
the most applied sense is the visual sense. However we also hear and listen to other museum
visitors, audio guides, spots for music examples, etc., which influence the museum
experience. Due to the shift to more hands-on exhibits, the haptic sense also becomes more
applied and the sense of smell belongs to this multisensory experience of exhibitions.
Exemplary evidence for this multisensory experience and the influence of other senses on the
visual sense will follow in Chapter 8. This section will demonstrate that MET combined with
cued retrospective reporting also interweave the senses by providing hints for the use of
senses beyond vision.
In sum, we stroll through exhibitions with our complete body including all our senses.
Although vision is the dominant sense and the one I mainly focus on in this research.

(iv)

Bodily experience:

As the museum experience is a multisensory experience, the museum experience is also a
bodily experience, because visitors stroll through exhibitions (Korff & Thiemeyer 2008) with
34

their complete body including all senses and the mind. That is why embodiment plays such a
crucial role in a museum (learning) experience like I described above in the section about
“appropriation”.
This bodily aspect of the museum experience is taken seriously in my research as I am not
only focusing on eye movements but also on the head and body movements that visitors make
when strolling through the three dimensional exhibition space.

(v)

Emotional experience:

Watson (2015) summarizes the current state of art that emotions and cognition are intertwined
in human beings. She points out that museums are creating emotional experiences through
design, the use of media, objects and narrative stories. She states that research has only
recently investigated the emotional aspects of the visitors' museum experience. Until then
“Emotions have been strangely neglected in the theory and practice of museums and
galleries” (Watson 2015: 286).
Much of the visitor research focusing on emotions is concerned with the role of emotions in
learning (Falk & Dierking 2002 and Falk & Gillespie 2009 quoted by Watson 2015: 286).
Only very recently has the emotional aspect of aesthetic experience of artworks been
researched. This investigation was performed by the project “Emotion: Mapping the Museum
Experience” (http://www.mapping-museum-experience.com/) in an integrated methodology
by Merging Movement Tracking, Physiology, and Psychological Data of specific artworks
(Tröndle et al. 2014).
As the reader will see later on that the instruction for visitors’ reporting in my visitor research
also clearly solicited reports about the feelings visitors’ felt while they were viewing the
exhibition.

(vi)

Social experience:

Emotions can be shared with others. We stroll through exhibitions not only with our own
body but also with the companionship of others, like friends and family members or
foreigners like other museum visitors or museum staff members. Hence, the

museum
35

experience is defined as a social experience (Falk & Dierking 2013). This social experience
entails the possibility to talk about the exhibition with each other which leads to better
information processing and hence to better learning effects (Falk & Dierking 2000).
As will be shown, the social aspect is also valid in the movement patterns of visitors but apart
from that, the social aspect was neglected in my visitor research due to reasons of
practicability.

(vii)

Entertaining experience:

This social museum experience cannot only be educational it can be also entertaining in
exhibitions themselves, in guided tours, in workshops and other events. As we just learned
according to the “Contextual Model of Learning”, learning in museums is not only reduced to
the exhibition visit (Falk & Dierking 2013). Thus, the educational role of museums also
enhances guided tours and events as well as the creation of these (Hooper-Greenhill 1999).
Hence, the museum experience can be defined as an experience that is characterized by a
mixture of education and entertainment. Museums are places of edutainment, which is why
education and entertainment in museums should not be a question of either/or but rather
should be one incorporating agenda of the exhibition makers (Falk et al. 1998). According to
Falk et al. (1998: 117-118), “education and entertainment should not be viewed as mutually
exclusive motivations for coming to a museum but rather as complementary aspects of a
complex leisure experience”.
My research focuses on the edutainment aspect of the museum experience provided by digital
guides. In sum, my research contributes mainly to the learning aspect of the museum
experience focusing on the visual sense that is incorporated in the whole visitor body that
strolls through exhibitions, thereby concentrating on single visitors and not on groups. It
focuses only on the emotional experience. Furthermore, this research contributes to the
edutainment of visitors through digital media.
Where exactly is this holistic multifaceted museum experience gained? What is the field of
museum exhibitions and of my audience research exactly? A general introduction into the
field is provided in the next paragraph.

2.4. Museum Exhibitions
After describing the affordances, appropriations and experiences in museums exhibitions, I
want to briefly define museums and museum exhibitions. Furthermore, I introduce the two
types of museums that are relevant for my research: ethnographic museums displaying
Oceania in Germany and historico-cultural literature museums in Germany. This knowledge
shall prepare the reader for the detailed description of the two research settings “The South
Sea Oases – Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in
Stuttgart and the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo in Marbach a. N. presented in Chapter 3.

2.4.1. Museums and Museum Exhibitions
According to Anke te Heesen (2012), the origin of the museum can be placed in different
periods depending on the aspect you want to stress. Stressing the long history of this
institution, the term “museum” is derived from the Greek term “Mouseion” which means a
temple for the Muses, the goddesses of arts in Greek mythology. Hence, a museum is a
building for the study of arts. Stressing the scientific aspect, the history of the museums starts
with the cabinets of arts and wonder in the Renaissance (cf. also Macdonald 1998). Stressing
the opening to the public, the history of museums starts in the second half of the 18th century.
In the 19th Century, when the museum landscape was formed as we know it today, the
academic disciplines at universities and the respective museums had a strong connection
(Hartung 2010). Currently our project Knowledge & Museum or the Humboldt-Forum in
Berlin try to reconnect them again.
Let me briefly indicate that this thesis is about museum exhibitions in the sense of exhibitions
that are integrated in a museum rather than exhibitions hosted elsewhere. According to Anke
te Heesen (2012), museums and exhibitions are not the same although currently these terms
are often mixed. Historically the term “exhibition” is derived from the Latin “exponere” and
initially emerged in the 18th century. The two terms “museum” and “exhibition” were brought
together at the end of the 19th century. Hence, the current museum incorporates not only
collections but also exhibitions.
In my experience, visitors are usually not aware of this difference and the multifaceted tasks
and rooms a museum entails behind the scenes. Nevertheless I focus on museum

exhibitions

since they are physically integrated into the museum, which is a building with its history, a
37

place of collection, conservation, research, display and knowledge transfer. This physical
integration stands in contrast to exhibitions that were historically created elsewhere and for
rather economic reasons.
Apart from that, museums have gone through many changes. The most recent and important
ones are: (i) the opening to the public, (ii) the learning aspect, (iii) the idea of the participatory
museum and (iv) the implementation of digital guides. These changes are as follows:
(i)

The history of museums is characterised by democratisation and opening to the public.
At the end of the 19th century, the emerging educated middle-class got the chance to
gain more cultural capital (Bourdieu 1982, Laukötter 2013) and thus strengthen their
position in society. Bourdieu (as mentioned above) figured out that the museum
visitors are still higher educated in the 20th century and no one in the 21st century
would deny that. This main result of Bourdieu presented in The Love of Art
(1969/1997) is still valid and became common sense.

(ii)

The learning aspect as described above is crucial for the current museum definition. It
is clearly a task for exhibition makers to focus on the learning aspect of their
exhibitions.

(iii)

Consequently, the idea of providing further possibilities for active visitor participation
emerged instead of the previous passive consumption of knowledge. The idea of the
participatory museum that engages the museum visitors to actively participate and
contribute to museum exhibitions, most famously represented by the American
designer Nina Simon. Simon (2010: 18) asks, “how participants’ actions will
contribute positively to the institution and to future audiences”. She blames the design
of participatory offerings to museum visitors for their unhelpful outcome instead of
blaming the visitors themselves.

(iv)

Often museums provide digital guides for engaging visitors actively in exhibitions as
described in Chapter 1. This implementation and rise of digital guides in museum
exhibitions changed the museums image and work as well as it changes the museum
visitor behaviour. Thus, it provides also a new research area for visitor studies.

Today the term “museum” is defined by the International Council of Museums (ICOM 2015;
Statutes art. 3 para. 1) as “a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its
development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and

38

exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes
of education, study and enjoyment”.
However, “the museum does not exist” as Sharon Macdonald (1996: 4; italics in original)
already correctly summarized. Hence to classify museums according to their main collections
into museums types like art museums, historico-cultural museums, ethnographic museums,
natural history museums and scientific/technique museums, etc. is reductionist (Hartung
2010: 8) and over-simplifies the museum landscape.

2.4.2. Ethnographic and Historico-Cultural Literature Museums
Nevertheless due to the research settings in this thesis I want to shed light on two museum
types: ethnographic museums, especially the history of ethnographic museums with
exhibitions about Oceania in Germany, and historico-cultural museums, especially literature
museums in Germany.

•

Ethnographic museums (displaying Oceania in Germany)

The German term “Südsee” (South Sea) is derived from Spanish navigator Vasco Núñez de
Balboa’s titling “Mar del Sur” and the term “Pazifik” (Pacific) is derived from Portuguese
navigator Fernão Magelhaes titling “Mar Pacífico” in regards to the competitive colonisation
powers (Kaufmann 2008: 36) and the calm sea he experienced (Wendt 2013: 43). The term
“Oceania” comprises three regions of the Pacific (Wendt 2013: 43): Micronesia (‘small
islands’ north of New Guinea and east of the Philippines), Melanesia (‘dark islands’ – due to
the dark colour of the indigenous skin – comprising New Guinea and the islands East to Fiji)
and Polynesia (‘many islands’; a triangle of many islands from Hawai’i, to the Easter Islands
and New Zealand including also Tahiti, Samoa and Tonga). Sometimes Australia and these
three regions are summarized as ‘Oceania’, too.
Although once the connection between European colonisers and the “Südsee” was strong,
Christian Kaufmann (2008) describes the potential loss of the “Südsee” in Europe. He starts
with the history of the collections, museums and perception of the “Südsee” in Europe and
German speaking regions. Kaufmann (2008) divides this history into different periods.
39

Firstly, the cabinets of curiosity showed curiosities of the “savages” to the sovereigns at home
in the 17th century until 1850. Secondly, from 1800-1914 ethnographic museums or so-called
“Völkerkundliche Sammlungen” (“ethnographic collections”) were established to show
original objects of the colonised “primitives” who were conceived as still living like we lived
in the Stone Age. Hence, the perception of indigenous people was framed by evolutionary
thoughts. Thirdly, from 1890-1980 so-called “Völkerkundemuseen” were established that
displayed objects of so-called “Naturvölker” (“primitive people”) – conceived as living like
“hunters-and gatherers” – as evidence for cultures that were thought of as dying out. Fourthly,
from the 1960s until approximately 2010 museums of civilizations or cultures were
established. These museums display objects including photographs as memories of the past
and the present developing nations that experienced cultural revivals in many regards. This
period is characterized by re-contextualisation of objects for the present time.
Through all these periods an ambivalent perception of the “Südsee” ranging from being
Paradise to being the homeland of “noble savages” who are cannibals was manifested and is
still influencing the contemporary (visitor) perception (of ethnographic exhibitions) in
Germany (Kaufmann 2008; Wendt 2013). Reinhardt Wendt (2013) attributes this ambivalent
perception to European desires and critiques against their own society in Europe or in
Germany. He refers to Gabriele Dürbeck’s term “Ozeanism” (Dürbeck 2007: 4-6), which she
created referring to Edward Said’s (1978) term of “Orientalism”, for the German literature
about Oceania between 1815 and 1914. In his book, Orientalism Said reveals that our
perception of the Orient is rather connected to our expectations of it. Hence, our perception of
the “Südsee” was and – believe – is still a Eurocentric misperception. As it will be shown in
the exhibition description the exhibition makers created the special exhibition called “South
Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” (Linden-Museum in Stuttgart) because
they wanted to play with our prejudices and misperception. They counterpoint our biases with
the contemporary reality of the destruction of islands4 due to the rise of the sea levels from
global warming.
Hence, the perception of the “South Sea” and its representation in German museums is a
highly political issue as Sharon Macdonald puts it generally in her edited book The Politics of
Display (1998: 3) with reference to Michel Foucault’s Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the
Prison (1977) and Governmentality (1991):
4

Another destruction was happening to Oceania due to several nuclear weapons tests; the atomic test by the USA
on the Bikini Atoll is the most famous one (Wendt 2013).

40

“Politics, in other words, lies not just in policy statements and
intentions (though these are important) but also in apparently nonpolitical and even ‘minor’ details, such as the architecture of
buildings, the classification and juxtaposition of artefacts in an
exhibition, the use of glass cases or interactives, and the presence or
lack of a voice-over on a film”.
Hence, visitor research should be based on a detailed description of the respective museum
exhibitions regarding these aspects.
There are approximately 30-38 ethnographic museums in Germany depending on the source
you choose (DGV 2015). They range from big and famous ones that are financed by the
government of the respective state or city or run by universities or by foundations to small
ones that are sometimes even run on a voluntary basis. Many of these ethnographic museums
have an Oceanic collection. An official complete list of all ethnographic collections in
Germany does not currently exist (personal communication with Larissa Förster – head of the
working group “museum” in the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Völkerkunde – on 3rd November
2015). Accordingly, a few big and famous examples will have to suffice here:
•

Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin-Dahlem

•

Museum für Völkerkunde in Hamburg

•

Grassi Museum für Völkerkunde in Leipzig

•

Museum Fünf Kontinente, Staatliches Museum für Völkerkunde in Munich

•

Rautenstrauch Joest Museum für Völkerkunde of Cologne

•

Überseemuseum in Bremen

•

Weltkulturen Museum in Frankfurt

•

Linden-Museum – Staatliches Museum für Völkerkunde in Stuttgart

Ethnographic museum exhibitions about Oceania in Germany are based on their huge
collections of Oceanic exhibits (Kaufmann 2008). The multifarious “Ethnographika”
(ethnographic objects) were brought to the natural history or ethnographic museums by
private collectors, trading houses or by expeditions organized by the museums themselves.
These “Ethnographika” were bought, bartered or even stolen. Especially the “Hamburger
Südsee Expedition” (Hamburg’s South Sea expedition) from 1908-1910 enlarged

these

41

collections and produced a huge amount of literature about the expedition and its collection
comprising 17 volumes in 29 parts (Kaufmann 2008; Wendt 2013).
Firstly, the main aim was to collect as many objects as possible; later the provenance and
contextualization became more important (Laukötter 2013). Due to the evolutionary mindsets
at that time, collecting objects was seen as rescuing them from being lost and destroyed,
“womit sich Völkerkunde und Kolonialismus gegenseitig legitimierten” (“with what
anthropology and colonialism legitimized each other”; Laukötter 2013: 242).
As the history of ethnographic museums in Germany starts with colonization, ethnographic
museums in Germany are currently discussed as “(post)koloniale Erinnerungsorte” (“postcolonial places of remembrance”) in the context of the establishment of the Humboldt-Forum
in Berlin (Laukötter 2013: 233). Hence, issues of cultural appropriation by the ethnographic
museums are often discussed and even researched currently.
At the end of the 19th century according to Laukötter (2013: 238; italics in original)
“Völkerkundemuseen wollten und konnten also keine »Völker« zeigen, sondern stattdessen
Repräsentationen ihrer kulturellen Ausdrucksformen (“ethnographic museums did not want
and could not display ethnic groups but rather display representations of their cultural
expressions”). Thus viewing so-called “Ethnographika” (“ethnographic objects”) became a
crucial moment for ethnographic exhibitions by providing the perception of the culturally
close and familiar realities of one’s own culture and the culturally distant and foreign realities
of other cultures. These differences between ‘us’ and ‘them’ were viewed according to the
evolutionary worldview of that time and were validated by ethnographic objects. However,
the selection criteria of ethnographic objects for display were not transparent for museum
visitors (Laukötter 2013). Laukötter’s estimation of the former situation of ethnographic
museums seems still valid for contemporary ethnographic museum and their visitors.

•

Historico-cultural museums and the special case of literature museums (in Germany)

Historico-cultural museums usually exhibit objects related to the local history of the
respective region. These museums comprise a wide range of different issues like archaeology,
local industries, religion, music, literature etc. to name a few.

42

There are more than 200 literature museums in Germany (Kussin 2001). Scheuffelen (2001:
48-49) differentiates between four types of literature museums: (i) memorials at authentic
places, (ii) literature museums close to but not displayed at authentic places, (iii) literature
departments at museums of local history and (iv) documental exhibitions at public places like
libraries, schools, etc. To build museums for displaying literature is very seldom done and my
research setting the LiMo in Marbach a. N. is one of these exceptions. The establishment of
the LiMo was conceptualized at the beginning of this new millennium – a phase of rethinking
literature exhibitions as was done by the conference “Dichterhäuser im Wandel” at the
Museum for Literature am Oberrhein in Karlsruhe in 2000.
At this conference Susanne Lange-Greve (2001), who worked at the Schiller National
Museum in Marbach a. N. in 1990, differentiates between poet houses that work as memorial
places for particular authors stressing literature history and exhibitions about literature itself.
She compares the latter literature exhibitions with art exhibitions as literature shares the same
features as artworks, because both are forms of art: both are made of signs that transport
ambiguous meanings. Hence, “Literaturausstellungen sind eine Form des Nachdenkens über
Literatur anhand von Exponaten” (“Literature exhibitions are a kind of thinking about
literature via exhibits”; Lange-Greve 2001: 30), Literature exhibitions should not tell the
visitors what to think but enable visitors to actively interpret these meanings themselves.
Besides, Lange-Greve thinks that literature exhibitions face the same de- and
recontextualisation of exhibits as all other kinds of exhibitions do.
Similar to the comparison of literature exhibitions with art exhibition by Lange-Greve, Hans
Joachim Klein (2001), who is the founder of the “Zentrum für Evaluation und
Besucherforschung” (ZEB) (Centre for Evaluation and Visitor Research) at the Badisches
Landesmuseum in Karlsruhe, Germany, compares the target group of literature museums with
the target group of art museums. He states that the difference between these target groups is
that exhibiting literature is far more difficult and is only interesting for an expert audience.
Hence, this characterization distinguishes literature museums from ethnographic museums.

2.5. Conclusion
In sum, this chapter provided a flavour of fundamental concepts and terms like the ‘theory of
affordance’ by Gibson (1979), the appropriation of exhibits and exhibitions by the visitors,
43

and the contemporary multi-faceted museum experience. It demonstrated first hints that
particular affordances might lead to particular distinct movement patterns, which shall be
demonstrated in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. It defined the appropriation of exhibits and exhibitions
as a performative act that is executed through several distinct, recurrent and systematic eye,
head, trunk and body movements. This embodiment of museum exhibitions shapes the
museum experience. Hence, the visual sense mainly (not exclusively) guides our learning,
aesthetic, bodily, emotional, social and entertaining museum experience.
This chapter also defined the broader setting of this research – “museum” and “museum
exhibitions” – and provided a brief history of ethnographic and literature museums in
Germany. This was done to prepare the reader for the detailed descriptions of the two
investigated research settings: the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western
Pacific” exhibition at the Linden Museum Stuttgart and the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo in
Marbach a. N. presented in the following Chapter 3.

44

3. The Two Museum Exhibitions: Research at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart and the
Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach a. N.
This chapter provides descriptions of the two concerned exhibitions and their museums: the
temporary special “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at
the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart and the permanent “nexus” exhibition at the Museum of
Modern Literature (LiMo) in Marbach a. N. As the focus of my research is on the
ethnographic exhibition “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” the
description of it will be more extensive than about the “nexus” exhibition. Hence the floor
plan will be more detailed and four selected sections of the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival Western Pacific” exhibition will be described in detail. Nevertheless both general
descriptions concentrate on these aspects: the backgrounds of the research or its context, short
histories of the museums, short descriptions of the museums as the hosting institutions,
detailed descriptions of the researched exhibitions, their digital guides, and last but not least
short characterizations of their typical visitors. As the reader will see, these two exhibitions
and their hosting museums are quite different both in regards to their subject matter but also
in other ways. Hence, this chapter concludes with a comment on the comparability of these
two exhibitions as the research settings to study movement patterns in.

3.1. The Temporary Special Exhibition “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the
Western Pacific” and its Audio Guide at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart
The description of the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition
is based on my own documentation, interviews, personal communication, information on the
Linden-Museums website and the exhibition catalogue. It is two-fold: Firstly, I will describe it
in general whereas the main description will provide a detailed floor plan. Secondly, I will

3.1.1. General Description
The general description about the temporary special “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in
the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart will entail the following:
the background of the research; the history of the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart; an overview
about the museum and its Oceania department; a general introduction to this special
exhibition and its audio guide; and last but not least a short characterization of the typical
Linden-Museum in Stuttgart visitors.

The Background

As mentioned in the introduction I conducted two visitor studies at the temporary special
exhibition “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” presented from the 5th
December 2009 until 6th June 2010 at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart, curated by Ingrid
Heermann in cooperation with Ulrich Menter. These studies were designed to identify
movement patterns and the influence of the audio guide on them. These visitor studies were
solely conducted for my PhD thesis. I have a strong connection to the Linden-Museum in
Stuttgart, as this museum was my reason for studying cultural anthropology. Through the
years I worked at the Linden-Museum: first as a museum attendant; then as an intern within
the public relations department; and finally as a freelancer within the museum education
department for the special exhibition about Australia in 2005/2006. Hence, the LindenMuseum and I have a strong and old personal history.

The History

The Linden-Museum – headed by Inés de Castro since 2010 – was established at Hegelplatz
in Stuttgart in 1911. It is a neo-classical building that was built by Bihl and Woltz according
to

the

construction

plan

of

their

architect

Georg

Eser

(Württembergischer

Kunstgewerbeverein 1908/1909: 216-217).
The history of the Linden-Museum started with the foundation of the “Association for Trade,
Geography, and Promotion of German Interests Abroad” in 1882 (original name:
“Württembergischer Verein für Handelsgeographie und Förderung deutscher Interessen im
Ausland e. V”.) which is currently called “Society for Geography and Ethnography in
46

Stuttgart” (original name: “Gesellschaft für Erd- und Völkerkunde zu Stuttgart e. V”; LindenMuseum in Stuttgart website 2014a). This association was founded to establish new trading
opportunities beyond the European borders and to inform the people of Stuttgart about nonEuropean cultures. The idea of building a museum was born in 1884 at the beginning
colonization. Initially the idea was to build a museum that focused on new trading
opportunities that opened at the “House of Economy” (original name: “Haus der Wirtschaft”)
in Stuttgart in 1889. Later since Count Linden was the head of the association, he changed
this aim to give preference for building an ethnographic museum, although Theodor Wanner,
the treasurer of the Association, still preferred the focus on trading opportunities. As the
collection was growing, more space was needed. Hence, it was decided to build a museum
building at Hegelplatz where it is still placed. No wonder that this museum was named after
Linden. Unfortunately Count Linden died before its opening (Kußmaul 1987: 10; de Castro
2014).
Although the era of German colonies ended after the First World War in 1918, the museum
still aimed to inform visitors about non-European cultures. Luckily, it was mostly protected
against the Nazi-Regime. Parts of the building and parts of the collection were lost during the
Second World War although many objects were saved by evacuation. Being a private
museum for many years even the rebuilding was paid for by the budget of the association,
which left the association was in debt. Luckily the city of Stuttgart helped the association
since 1953, and since 1964 the country Baden-Württemberg also helped. Nevertheless not
until 1973 did the museum become a publicly governed institution. Since then the city of
Stuttgart and the country Baden-Württemberg equally fund the museum – while the “Society
for Geography and Ethnography in Stuttgart” is still part of the Linden-Museum as a friends’
association and still informs about non-European cultures by lectures or arranged travels.
After becoming a state museum, the urgently needed renovations could be done from 1978 to
1985. Just in time for its 75th anniversary, the museum reopened with new permanent
exhibitions in 1985 and 1986 (Kußmaul 1987: 11, 16, 24; de Castro 2014).
Due to the 100th anniversary in 2011, some changes have been made: a metallic globe
presenting the logo of loxodromes (a spiral-shaped line circulating around the poles) in front
of the building and the lettering Linden-Museum installed on the building’s façade (de Castro
2014; Linden-Museum website 2014b).

The Museum

Today the Linden-Museum (see Figure 3) is one of the most important ethnographic museums
in Europe. The collection of the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart encompasses 160 thousand
exhibits of the completely non-European world but it is not all encompassing (audio guide
number 001). It is based on exemplary collected objects and focuses on the cultural meanings
of these objects (Kußmaul 1987: 10).
At the time of data collection (December 2009 until June 2010) five permanent exhibitions
were on display: parts of the North America exhibition on the ground floor (whereas the
South America exhibition was closed due to the display of the special exhibition), Africa and
the Islamic Orient on the first floor, South Asia and East Asia on the second floor. Through
the years, the exhibition space for the permanent exhibition about the Oceania was minimized.
Since 2001 the permanent exhibition was shut down and only special exhibitions displayed
parts of Oceania (see Table 1):

Table 1: Temporary special exhibitions presenting parts of Oceania since the closing of the
permanent exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart

Firstly, the space was needed for the special exhibition “Shape – Colour – Fantasy“, secondly,
the space was needed for other special exhibitions developed by other regional departments
and finally yet importantly, financial reasons averted a new permanent exhibition to date.
However maybe this is also a sign of the loss of Oceania Kaufmann (2008, see Chapter 2)
spoke of or rather the meaning shift of Oceania for Germany and their relationship: The first
principal of the Linden-Museum, Augustin Krämer, was a specialist for Oceania (Kußmaul
49

1987: 15). Once parts of Oceania became a colony, then other collections at the LindenMuseum started growing, like the one about Asia (Kußmaul 1987, 82 ff.). Now there is hardly
any connection to Oceania in our daily life and even at the universities in Germany, you will
hardly find professors who still study Oceania.
Although there are seven different regional departments in one institution they all share
common aims. Firstly, they wish to remain an ethnographic museum that informs visitors
about non-European cultures and promotes intercultural dialogue. Secondly, the collections
are still the heart of the museum and the museum provides direct encounters via exhibits.
Thirdly, the museum still aims to serve its visitors (Linden-Museum in Stuttgart website
2014b). Thereby the Linden-Museum is still engaged in the four classical tasks, namely
collecting, restoring, researching and exhibiting. This is complemented by the museum
education program, lectures and events like theatre performances, concerts, etc.
Besides the exhibition galleries, there are several other rooms and tasks located in the
museum. On the ground floor:
•

On the right: the Wanner hall named after the former treasurer Theodor Wanner for
lectures, events, and sometimes for very small exhibitions at the back of the hall;
within the hall: the entrance to the library, before the hall: the outsourced restaurant;

•

In the middle of the ground floor: the new info counter;

•

On the left of the ground floor: the museum shop.

On the first floor:
•

The film projection room that is used for various tasks like meetings, film shows,
museum education offers, workshops etc.

Additionally there are several offices, storage rooms, repair shops and ateliers for restoration
and photography on all floors (underneath, on and above the exhibition levels) that are not
open to the public.

The Exhibition

Figure 4: View from the entrance into the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western
Pacific” exhibition (photograph by Kira Eghbal-Azar with kind permission from the LindenMuseum in Stuttgart)

The “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition (see Figure 4)
was a special temporary exhibition presenting an estimated 450 exhibits in 1200 m² based on
the Linden-Museum collections mainly collected by Krämer and Senfft and loans from other
museums (Interview with Ingrid Heermann 20th October 2010, Heermann 2009: 7). Krämer
was the first director of the Linden-Museum (as mentioned above) who travelled in
Micronesia as a naval doctor in 1898, and was the head of Hamburg’s South Sea Expedition
in 1909/1910 (Kußmaul 1987: 15, Heermann 2009: 7, 23). Senfft worked for the district
office in Yap from 1904 until 1906 and provided collections in 1901 and 1905 to Count
Linden for his museum (Heermann 2009: 7, 23). Unfortunately, the Micronesia collections of
the Linden-Museum are sparsely documented and some islands and atolls are inadequately
represented or even missing. Besides other sources, the publication of the results of the
“Hamburgian South Sea Expedition” has been most helpful to contextualize the exhibits
(Heermann 2009: 23 and Interview with Ingrid Heermann 20th October 2010).
51

The idea for exhibiting Micronesia was born in a discussion with the colleagues Antje Denner
and Dietrich Schleip about Micronesia and climate change more than ten years ago before its
opening. They wondered what would happen if the one hundred year old exhibits lose their
countries of provenance. While working out the concept of the exhibition Ingrid Heermann
figured out that the climate has always been an important factor for the life and survival on
the islands and atolls (Heermann 2009: 5):
“Only step by step it has become clear that surprisingly, it is the topic “climate”, in the
broader sense – in terms of living under precarious climate conditions – which links the past
to the present”.
(Original quote: “Erst nach und nach wurde deutlich, dass es erstaunlicherweise gerade das
erweiterte Thema Klima – im Sinne von Lebensgestaltung unter klimatisch unsicheren
Bedingungen – ist, das gestern und heute verbindet”.)
Hence navigation, boat building and rituals for controlling the weather conditions are crucial
issues for this exhibition. Additionally, the curator wants to present several qualities: firstly,
the region itself (see the maps presented in the exhibition in Figure 15 and 16) because it is
unknown to most of the visitors; secondly, the creativity of producing a broad variation of
items with only few available materials (weavings, jewellery, houses, weapons, tools etc.);
thirdly, the available food (mainly taro, breadfruit, pandanus, coconuts and fish); fourthly
particular characteristics (the Kiribati warriors, tattooing, tino sculptures from Nukuoro etc.);
and last but not least the cultural change through colonization considering that most exhibits
are already made for European collectors. All issues demonstrate the difficulty of life and
survival that the Western Pacific is now facing – they have always been at risk of stormy
weather and now climate change has brought new struggles. The connections between the
islands and atolls and their ritualized commodity exchange and adoption of children are the
solution and their social safety net (Heermann 2009).
For a better illustration of the exhibition, I provide a detailed floor plan consisting of 10
figures. These figures show the seven galleries of the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in
the Western Pacific” exhibition. The floor plan provides the title of the galleries; the exhibits
within display cabinets and freestanding exhibits; interactive hands-on exhibits; position of
text panels, photos, films, children’s play areas and audio guide spots (see the key presented
in Figures 5-14). The floor plan figures of the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the
Western Pacific” exhibition are joint work of my student assistant Linda Greci and the author.
Emma Steinbach did the proof reading of the English version.

52

The “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition is characterized
by its contemporary presentation style for ethnographic exhibitions: it encompasses
accessible, freestanding exhibits

and non-accessible exhibits in display cabinets

(approximately 450 exhibits in sum), several installations, 5 hands-on exhibits, several
photographs, 3 films, 43 text panels and digital guide (in this case an audio guide see Figure
18). Note that all display cabinets in this exhibition are front-glass display cabinets. Hence,
visitors can view them only from the front side.
Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the Western Pacific region: Micronesia and its migration flows.
It is obvious that the great ocean between the islands characterizes Micronesia. In contrast to
the emic concept of the sea as the connecting element between the islands (preamble of the
constitution of the Federates States of Micronesia cited by Petrosian-Husa 2009), the title of
the exhibition is stressing the islands and atolls as Oases – a rather etic view on Micronesia.
Herrmann Mückler originated the title “South Sea Oases”. It is inartfully expressed and was
chosen before working out the concept of the exhibition (Interview with Ingrid Heermann 20th
May 2010).

The information level presented on text panels, labels and audio guide texts is mixed with
exhibits. Visitors always choose which information and in which form (text, label or audio
guide) they prefer. Text panels include a heading and descriptions of several issues, which
you can read in the appendices 10.1.1. Labels like the example shown in Figure 17 provide
the following information: the name of the exhibit that reflects what it is (e.g., Frauengeld
toluk), where it comes from (e.g., Palau), what it is made of (e.g., tortoiseshell), to which
collection abbreviated in “Slg” for the German term “Sammlung” and the year it belongs to
(e.g., Augustin Krämer, 1912; Ernst Hengstenberg 1902), and finally the accession number
abbreviated with “Inv. Nr.” for the German term “Inventarnummer” (e.g.: 76357, 76356,
27443, 76359).

64

Figure 17: Example of a label in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western
Pacific” exhibition (photograph by Kira Eghbal-Azar with kind permission from the LindenMuseum in Stuttgart)

Besides this information level, guided tours conducted by cultural anthropologists with a
specialization in Oceania can provide further information. The identically named catalogue
Südsee Oasen: Leben und Überleben im Westpazifik (2009) contextualizes the exhibits a bit
more than the exhibition itself. While it is mainly written by the curator herself, sometimes
guest authors also contribute; past guest authors have included Katja Göbel, Susanne
Kuehling, Brian Diettrich, Lothar Käser, Carmen Petrosian-Husa, Eric Metzgar, Martin J.
Schneider and Ulrich Menter. It is a useful information medium that is unfortunately not sold
very often (interview with Ingrid Heermann 20th May 2010, Herrmann 2009).
The presentation practice of the “South Seas Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific”
exhibition follows the guideline of a general guided tour through the exhibition by the curator
Ingrid Heermann (interview with Ingrid Heermann 20th May 2010). Hence, it is a narrative
and interpretative exhibition telling the story of life and survival in the Western Pacific now
and then with mainly one hundred year old objects. This presentation style partially is very
pragmatic and it spontaneously arose while arranging the exhibits in the gallery. Thereby the
curator’s intention was explicitly not to create a myth of the South Sea (interview with Ingrid
Heermann 20th May 2010).
The exhibits were selected for their quality, form, function, expression, meaning, story and
history. The atmosphere of the exhibition is unobtrusively kept mainly in two colours, blue
and green, because these are the main colours of the Micronesian landscape. The first gallery
especially creates the feeling of a wide ocean due to the aquarium and the big map at the back
65

and the Wuvulu canoe in the middle. Apart from that, the exhibition has been adjusted to the
colours of the background that were already there (interview with Ingrid Heermann 20th May
2010).

The Digital Guide: an Audio-Guide

Figure 18: The audio guide at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart (photograph by Kira EghbalAzar with kind permission from the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart)

The audio guide at the Linden-Museum (see Figure 18) is a device named PG III 512 MB
from the company Tonwelt. In sum, 96 audio guides are available at the Linden-Museum for a
deposit of an identity card or a driver’s license. At the time of data collection, the fee for an
audio guide was included in the entrance fee for the special exhibition; hence, no additional
fee had to be paid. Using the audio guide in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the
Western Pacific” exhibition is a free choice. This audio guide is easy to handle. You just have
to enter the particular number and press the play button. You can take a break, stop and even
press the forwarding or rewarding button. That is it. The buttons are big enough and therefore
easy to handle. It is even friendly to disabled persons who cannot view the exhibition at all or
properly enough. They can access the guide through a control point on button number five.
Tonwelt itself holds the copyright of the texts. The texts are partially reprinted here with the
66

permission and courtesy of Tonwelt. According to the curator who wrote the text in
cooperation with Tonwelt the audio guide, texts were written before the text panels in the
exhibition.
This audio guide provides optional information about the exhibits and exhibition themes.
Hence, it works as an additional didactic medium:
The first audio guide spot at the map is unfortunately not close to the entrance (original
German text in Appendices 10.1.1):
English Version: 800 – Map (German Version: 2:34 min., female voice, no music)
Welcome to the exhibition South Sea Oases – Life and Survival in the Western Pacific
The many small islands in the western Pacific that you see on the map here are collectively
known as Micronesia. They are very far from us – both literally and figuratively. Set in an
iridescent, turquoise-blue sea they are very beautiful. Yet they have neither mineral resources
nor other economic factors likely to attract international attention. The issue of climate change
is what has drawn these islands into the limelight at this time – and it is a tragic fact that in 20
or 30 years many of them may no longer be habitable.
In the past, too, the islands – especially the Atolls, which lie only meters above sea level –
have always been vulnerable to storms and tidal waves. The people of Micronesia developed a
range of tactics to deal with these threats – and we will be presenting them in the exhibition.
One strategy involved the precise observation of natural phenomena on land and sea and an
exact knowledge of the stars. The religious level of spirits and tutelary gods played an
important role, as well.
Let’s take a closer look at the map. The region called Micronesia extends across a gigantic
swath of ocean, 4,000 kilometres long. Far to the east are the islands of the Republic of
Kiribati (pronounced KIR-rih-bass). Further to the west lie the Marshall Islands, consisting of
two groups, stretching north-south. Like the islands of Kiribati, most of them are atolls. To the
west of the Marshalls are the high island of Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap and Palau, between
which are scattered the many atolls of the Caroline Islands. The cultures of these far-flung
islands are relatively similar – which speaks for the remarkable contacts between their
populations over hundreds of years. Let’s begin immersing ourselves in the cultures of
Micronesia.

The Visitors

Approximately 14,818 visitors viewed the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the
Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart. Whereas 69,102 visitors
viewed the whole museum exhibitions in 2009 and 64,214 in 2010 (note that the museum was
closed for renovation for two months in 2010). The Linden-Museum is not located in the
shopping mall of Stuttgart, but instead lies besides the touristic paths next to the Katharinen
Hospital. Imagine how many visitors it could welcome if it were placed in the shopping mall.
The department for public relations of the Linden-Museum stated that the target audience of
the Linden-Museums is: cultural active persons, families, post materialists and modern
performers (called after the Sinus-Milieus – an audience-typology of the market and social
research company SINUS Markt- und Sozialforschung GmbH 2014), visitors above 50 years
(best agers), and LOHAS people (Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability). The visitor survey
of the stARTistics company (2014; survey period from 22nd November 2013 – 16th March
2014, n = 1,162) of the special exhibition “Inca. Kings of the Andes” (original title: “Inka.
Könige der Anden” presented from 12th October 2013 – 16th March 2014 curated by Dr. Doris
Kurella and Prof. Dr. Inés de Castro) concluded via inductive statistics about all the LindenMuseum visitors that:
•

60% are over 60 years old

•

50% are academics

•

55% are female

•

55% live outside of Stuttgart

•

75% are from time to time visitors

More results characterizing the visitors of my visitor studies in the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition will follow in Chapter 4 and 5.

68

3.1.2. The Four Selected Sections
Four sections of the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition
were selected to compare the MET study with the observation study. The four selected
sections were selected according the following criteria:
•

Inherent to the exhibition, hence seemingly being a highlight, such as the men’s house
model, the weavings, jewellery and the life-size outrigger canoe

•

For comparison between different parts within the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition as well as between the “South Sea Oases:
Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition and the “nexus” exhibition such
as freestanding exhibits versus exhibits in display cabinets and homogenous display
cabinets versus heterogeneous display cabinets.

•

Due to investigation of the influence of digital guides on movement patterns, all
elements had to provide at least one audio guide spot.

Thus, the four selected sections are:
•

Section 1: The Men’s House Model from Palau

•

Section 2: The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap

•

Section 3: The Homogenous Display Cabinet

•

Section 4: The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet

The description of the four selected sections contains photographs and exhibit lists. All texts
of the text panels and the audio guide at each section can be read in the appendices 10.1.1.

As can be seen in Figure 22 the text panel about the men’s house model is displayed on the
right next to the galid house. The appertaining text panel has not been observed in the
systematic observation study due to the obstructed view and its large distance to the men’s
house model. Hence, it was also not examined in the MET study for reasons of comparability
between the two studies.

parts showing a broad range of different exhibits made of the sparsely available materials on
the islands and atolls.
The right part encompasses drinking vessel, pots, women’s money, spoons, money caddy,
money, decorative combs, bangle, coconut cup, pregnancy belt, one text panel (“Palau –
Money as Decoration”) and one audio guide spot (808: “Money, Barter, Valuables, Food

The left part encompasses a bandeau, decorative combs, belts, poncho, head decoration, mats,
necklace, earrings, hair stick, aprons for dancing, one text panel (“Turmeric, Spondylus and
Coconut Beads”) and one audio guide spot (809: “Chuuk, Curcuma”).

We now move from this detailed description of the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the
Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart to a more condensed
description of the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo.

3.2. The Permanent Exhibition “nexus” and its Multimedia Museum Guide (M3) at the
Museum of Modern Literature (LiMo) in Marbach a. N.
Now, I will describe the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo1 and its multimedia museum guide
(M3) in general. This description is based on my own observations and the huge amount of
literature about its concept. Therefore, it will only contain a simplified floor plan and more
textual description. Again, I will provide the background of the research, the history of the
LiMo, an overview about the LiMo, a general introduction to this permanent “nexus”
exhibition and its multimedia museums guide (M3), and last but not least a short
characterization of the typical LiMo visitors.

•

The Background

The visitor research at the LiMo in Marbach a. N. was part of the interdisciplinary
cooperation project called Knowledge & Museum: Archive – Exhibit – Evidence described in
the Prologue of this thesis. The aim of my Sub-project “Presentation Practice and Evidence
Attribution” was to conduct several visitor studies in the “nexus” exhibition at LiMo curated
by Heike Gfrereis. Firstly, in order to consult the museum for the revision of their portable
tablet-like medium, M3, available in the permanent exhibition “nexus”. Secondly, in order to
achieve new insights into movement behaviour and the influence of the digital guide M3.
Thus I conducted three different studies: firstly, a MET study which is comparable to the
MET study in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at
the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart. Secondly, a systematic observation study examined the
visitors’ stops across the exhibition on display cabinet level. It also evaluated the influence of
the use of the M3 on the visitors’ dwell time in “nexus”, the number of attended display
cabinets, and the linearity of the visitors’ procession paths through the exhibition. This

The History

The LiMo was established on the Schillerhöhe of Marbach in 2006. David Chipperfield
Architects built it under the direction of architect Alexander Schwarz (Schwarz 2003: 75).
The LiMo and the adjacent Schiller-Nationalmuseum (SNM) “are the only solely for the
exhibition of literature used buildings worldwide” (original quote: “sind weltweit die einzigen
ausschließlich für die Ausstellung von Literatur genutzten Gebäude” DLA 2013). Both
museums are headed by Heike Gfrereis since 2001 and are part of the Deutsches
Literaturarchiv Marbach a. N. (DLA; German Literature Archive).
The history of the DLA started with the foundation of the Swabian Schiller Society in 1895
(currently it is called the German Schiller Society – original name: Deutsche
Schillergesellschaft) due to the admiration of Schiller who was born in Marbach. The
Swabian Schiller Society established the Schiller Archive and Museum in 1903 that has called
itself the Schiller-Nationalmuseum (SNM) since 1922. In 1955, the DLA was established. In
face of the huge collection, it had become necessary to separate the archive from the museum
so an archive was built that included a library solely for storing and research (Ott 2003: 13-15,
30).
Since 1980 the “Arbeitsstelle für literarische Museen, Archive und Gedenkstätten in BadenWürttemberg” also called, “alim” (“Department for literature museums, archives and
memorial places in Baden-Württemberg“) was founded with its office at the SNM
(Scheuffelen 2001). With currently almost 100 literature museums and memorial places,
Baden-Württemberg has the most literature museums in Europe. The “alim” supervises and
supports these literature museums (alim 2015).
Since 1989, the Fellow House (Collegienhaus) accommodates visiting researchers (Ott 2003:
32). Hence, currently the DLA consists of four different buildings each one representing the
architectural style of its own time; therefore, architect Alexander Schwarz (2003: 63) calls
these buildings an “architectural zoo” (“Architekturzoo”).

76

The SNM is constructed like a castle and appears more like a Pantheon due to its domed
structure (Ott 2003: 15, 19-20). It works as a memorial for Schiller and other Swabian poets;
hence, the archival materials, even the handwritings, appear like relics. Ott (2003) compares
Marbach’s archive with Hades in contrast to the SNM as a Pantheon for worshipping poets.
The LiMo works as a building for the archival materials themselves; hence their materiality
foregrounds (Gfrereis 2003).

The Museum

Figure 27: The ‘Literaturmuseum der Moderne’ (LiMo) in Marbach a. N. (photograph by Kira
Eghbal-Azar by kind permission of the LiMo)

Continuing Marbach’s tradition the ‘Literaturmuseum der Moderne’ (LiMo) (see Figure 27)
hosts the Leibinger Auditorium for lectures and film projections and several permanent and
non-permanent exhibitions displaying a comprehensive collection of German literature from
the 20th and 21st century (Gfrereis 2003: 42-43). At the time of data collection, there were
three permanent exhibitions: “nexus”, “stilus” and “fluxus” (note that the “nexus” exhibition
77

and the “stilus” exhibition were closed in the meantime). Each permanent exhibition or
gallery has its own approach to literature:
“stilus” presents poems within a huge exhibit. By using the M3, visitors can “fish” out one
poem. In “stilus”, visitors are engaged to learn how to read poems hence literature. In contrast
“nexus” engages visitors in how to read the exhibited materials themselves (Gfrereis 2009:
13).
External curators such as authors themselves, publishers, literature reviewers and actors,
curate “fluxus” for example. Currently “fluxus” is used more often as a coproduction for
special exhibitions. The floor plan (see Figure 28) at the entrance level of the LiMo provides
an overview of all galleries:

Figure 28: Floor plan of the LiMo (photograph by Kira Eghbal-Azar with kind permission
from the LiMo)

The special exhibitions at the LiMo are connected with “nexus”. Hence there are special
exhibitions about a year (“1912 – One Year in the Archive” – original title: “1912: Ein Jahr
im Archiv” – presented from 04th March 2012 to 28th August 2012) or about a single author
78

(“Ernst Jünger: Worker at the Abyss” – original title: “Ernst Jünger: Arbeiter am Abgrund“ –
presented from 07th November 2010 to 27th March 2011) or on various issues (“I love you” –
original title: “Ich liebe Dich” – presented from 20th September 2011 to 29th January 2012).
You can find the years, authors and issues in “nexus” as well. Accordingly, it can happen that
single exhibits presented in “nexus” may move from “nexus” to a special exhibition for the
duration of the special exhibition. A short note at the exhibits position in “nexus” informs
about this moving. In contrast to the permanent exhibition, “nexus” the special exhibitions do
not divide the exhibition level from the information level. Accordingly, special exhibitions are
interpretative and narrative exhibitions in contrast to “nexus” (Gfrereis 2009: 13-14).
Besides the public galleries and rooms, the LiMo is connected with the archive and has
several rooms for preparing exhibitions, whereas the offices of the museum staff are located
in the SNM.

•

The Exhibition

The term “nexus” means connection and interrelations. This exhibition title does not provide a
precise imagining of what can be viewed and how it may appear. Visitors shall actively
connect the 1300 exhibits themselves. Accordingly, the exhibition is called “nexus”.
Connections can be established by comparison of two exhibits lying side by side or by
comparison of exhibits from the same author or year. The M3 can be used for establishing
connections and for viewing more details and making comparisons between the information
provided in the M3 and the exhibits, but using the M3 is free choice (Strittmatter 2012).
The “nexus” exhibition has several characteristics that make it unique:
Firstly, it presents the archival materials of the DLA as a 400 m² portfolio exhibition
exhibiting 1300 exhibits used or made in the 20th and 21st Century by authors writing in
German (Gfrereis 2009: 3, 12; Gfrereis 2008: 13). According to the head of the DLA, Ulrich
Raulff, this is done without focusing on literary epochs or historical events (Zimmermann
together with the DLA 2013). Nevertheless, the historical change in writing and materials is
demonstrated by the chronological order.
Secondly, “nexus” does not orientate itself to other literature exhibitions or houses of poets
(Gfrereis 2009: 8). In contrast the architecture of the LiMo refers to art museums (Gfrereis
2012: 138). Heike Gfrereis (2009: 4) summarizes the concept of “nexus”:

79

“In the permanent exhibition at the LiMo the archival materials are resorted by their date of origin or usage and are displayed in two aisles –
one designated to literature the other to life. In the first long aisle there
are manuscripts, in the second typescripts, mostly part of author
libraries – objects that show how literature is constructed and read – in
the last two aisles there are letters and relics, Kafka’s fork and
Thomas Mann’s christening robe, but also Ernst Jünger’s diary and
Hesse’s Nobel Prize Certificate; objects that do not so much reflect
the literature but show the authors as human beings”.

(Original quote: “In der Dauerausstellung im LiMo sind die Archivalien umsortiert, nach der
Zeit ihrer Entstehung oder auch Benutzung gelegt und in einen Weg der Literatur und einen
des Lebens eingereiht. In der ersten langen Reihe liegen Manuskripte, in der zweiten Bücher,
zumeist aus Autorenbibliotheken – Dinge, die zeigen, wie Literatur entsteht und gelesen wird
– in den letzten beiden Reihen Briefe und Reste, Kafkas Gabel und Thomas Manns Taufkleid,
aber auch Ernst Jüngers Tagebuch und Hesses Nobelpreisurkunde; Dinge, die nicht so sehr
in die Literatur hineinführen, sondern die Autoren als Menschen zeigen”.)
“nexus” contains 39 display cabinets that are serially numbered and arranged in the four rows
mentioned above. Whereas the display cabinets in the first row are accessible from all sides,
the other rows are only accessible from three sides (front and both sides) see Figure 30. Each
display cabinet contains five floors of glass shelves. Hence the visitors can view the exhibits
within these completely glassy display cabinets from various viewpoints and not only from
the front like in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition.
The exhibits are ordered chronologically along a period from 1894 to present. Please refer
firstly, to Figure 29 for a schematic overview of the arrangement of the different rows;
secondly, to Figure 30 for an insight into the exhibition itself; and thirdly, to Figure 31 for the
period within the exhibition.

permission from the LiMo)

Thirdly, another unique characteristic of “nexus” is that the single rows of display cabinets
present almost completely homogenous exhibits in a uniform way. Neither large, salient
exhibits outside of the cabinets nor any interactive hands-on exhibits, music or movies are
included in the exhibition. Instead, visitors face long rows of similar-looking exhibits.
Because of their similarities, visitors must take a closer step toward the display cabinet in
order to have a better view. Accordingly viewing the exhibits is the primary and only way to
explore the exhibition. What does this viewing probably look like? The answers will be
provided in Chapter 6.
Fourthly, another unique characteristic of “nexus” is that the exhibits are characterized twofold: on the one hand, they contain literary texts in their background and on the other hand the
exhibits’ materiality foregrounds. This two-fold character of the exhibits is constantly
balancing between its background and foreground. The curator wants the visitors to view
especially the exhibits’ materiality because she believes that “Of course, literature cannot be
exhibited. It is formed in the reader’s mind only” (“Natürlich kann man Literatur nicht
ausstellen. Sie realisiert sich erst im Kopf des Lesers”, Gfrereis 2007: 1) and furthermore “At
best, the curator consoles herself with the fact that the withholding of literature in the
82

exhibitions encourages the reading of it after the visit to the exhibition” (“Im besten Fall, so
tröstet man sich als Museumsleiter, verführt das Vorenthalten der Literatur in Ausstellungen
dazu, sie nach dem Ausstellungsbesuch zu lesen”; Gfrereis 2007: 3-4). Hence, visitors should
not read just the literary texts but rather shall learn to read literary exhibits where they can
explore how literature is constructed and which marks the life and the authors left on it
(Gfrereis 2009: 6, 9-11). Usually visitors have to be strongly interested to take time to explore
those details.
Marbach’s most favourite example for learning how to read literary exhibits is the manuscript
of “The Trial” by Franz Kafka. Kafka firstly wrote that K. has been “caught” (“gefangen”).
Later he cancelled this term and replaced it by the term “arrested” (“verhaftet”). With the term
“arrested” Kafka leads directly into the subject matter of his book right in the first sentence:
only one who has been arrested can be sentenced. Such knowledge about literature can only
be gained by reading original literary exhibits and not by reading printed books (Zimmermann
together with the DLA; Gfrereis 2009: 6, 8).
Fifthly, the position order does not provide an interpretation of the exhibits. The visitor has to
interpret the exhibits actively himself. Accordingly, the laying order is called “anti-semantic”
in Marbach (Thiemeyer 2013: 366; Gfrereis 2009: 20). That means firstly, that famous
exhibits are not presented as such, thus they are not necessarily put on eye-level; and
secondly, this exhibition is concentrating on its exhibits and does not provide a single
narration. However, there are possibilities for creating narrations due to the chronological
order (Habsburg-Lothringen 2012: 11). The “nexus” exhibition works like a matrix or an
index about a region (German written literature from the DLA) and a time frame (see above:
from 1894 to present) that can be explored individually (Strittmatter 2012: 338). Single
exhibits are presented as examples.
Sixthly, “nexus” presents mainly paper-made exhibits. Therefore, exhibits are exchanged or
pages are turned over or new exhibits are presented every six months (Gfrereis 2009: 4;
Strittmatter 2012: 339). Especially for “nexus” the device “Breathing with the Archive” is
valid (original title: “Atmen mit dem Archiv”, Gfrereis 2008). Because “nexus” provides an
archival experience and the archive is constantly growing and coming to new conclusions,
“nexus” adapts to this growth. Hence, exchanging and adding new exhibits is not only
performed due to the sensitive material but also because it is an inherent part of its concept.
Therefore, “nexus” is a vivid permanent exhibition that can be explored many times.

83

At last, another characteristic of “nexus” is its special atmosphere. It is part of Marbach’s
concept. Atmospheres of exhibitions are created by light, sound and colours and emerge in the
interaction between visitors and the exhibitions (cf. Böhme 1995: 34-39). “nexus” is
characterized by darkness, coolness and silence like a temple:
If you want to visit “nexus” you have to go “down to the Hades” (“hinunter in den Hades”) as
the staff is expressing the fact that “nexus” is not only thematically but also spatially on the
same level as the archive: under the ‘Schillerhöhe’ like the hill is called. The museum
building leads the visitors step by step into the darkness. Hence, visitors slowly adjust from
the bright light at the entrance level to the only 50 Lux in “nexus”. The darkness protects the
paper made exhibits (Schwarz 2003: 65, 70; Gfrereis 2009: 3; Gfrereis 2007: 1). The
numerous small LED lights illuminate the exhibits but they can disturb the view at the same
time. The wooden walls do not make this darkness lighter. Not all visitors experienced the
light in “nexus” as “a sea of lights” like one of my student assistants described. In contrast
visitors criticize the illumination very often and it is frequently the reason for ending the
gallery visit.
In addition to the darkness, the temperature in “nexus” is low (18 °C). Due to the darkness the
18°C feel even colder. Some visitors feel refreshed in summer. Some are not prepared for
such a climate and either freeze or appreciate the green blankets they can get at the museum
entrance. The distribution of the blankets probably originated in answer to the visitors’
critiques when faced with such weather.

•

The Digital Guide: the Multimedia Museum Guide (M3)

Furthermore, the main unique characteristic of “nexus” is the separation between exhibit level
and knowledge transfer or information level. The exhibit level only presents the exhibits with
coded labels that contain the year date of usage or origin and the author name. Their codes
can be used to get additional information about the exhibit in the multimedia museum guide
(M3; see Figure 32), which summarizes up more than 5000 pages of information. No further
labels or texts are presented within “nexus”. Text should not compete with text (Gfrereis
2009: 4, 12-13). Therefore, the M3 is the only medium of knowledge transfer in “nexus”.
Hence, the M3 is not an optional add-on but constitutes an integral part of the exhibition
because, without using M3, it could be difficult for the visitors to follow the exhibition’s
content. The M3 is regularly offered to every museum visitor, with the exception of groups,
for a deposit of 10€ at the entrance table. Fifty M3 are available in sum. The M3 is an
84

industrial device called Kaleo provided by the company Texxmo Mobile Solutions GmbH.
Support and Texxmo has provided accumulators as well. The content management system is
based on open source software and has been adjusted by the company Tegoro Solutions Ag
for the LiMo. The flash-GUI (graphical user interface) has been developed by the company
iart interactive (at that time iart Interactive and Element Design belonged together. Note that
iart Interactive and Tegoro fused together in January 2013).

Figure 32: The Multimedia Museum Guide (M3) (photograph by Kira Eghbal-Azar with kind
permission from the LiMo)

The introduction about “nexus” in the M3 reads as follows (original German text in
appendices 10.1.2.):
nexus. Connection and linkage. That what has been left from the 20th century, from literature
as well as from its writers and readers. A public collection of the great and forgotten names of
this archive – chronologically displayed from 1900 to 2000, sorted into two great long aisles:
the corpuses of literature (manuscripts and books) and the relicts of their authors (letters and
life testimonies).
You can take different paths through nexus: strolling around, drifting and just viewing or
viewing exhibits of one author, one particular period or exhibits with specific characteristics.
The M3 helps you research, identify, read, listen and link the exhibits.
85

To understand the M3 usage possibilities, a detailed description is provided as follows:
As can be seen in Figure 32, the menu of the M3 starts with a gallery note after the visitor has
actively logged in the “nexus” menu on the touch screen. This gallery note is the only written
introduction for the permanent exhibition “nexus”.
Afterwards the visitor must actively log into each display cabinet. Each display cabinet
contains a signal. The visitor has to hold the M3 right before that signal and press a key at the
same time to actively log in. Both steps of login are probably challenging for visitors.
Evidence for this is provided in Chapter 6.
Now an overview about the year numbers of this display cabinet appears. After pressing the
desired year number on the touch screen, all exhibits of this year number in this display
cabinet appear. Now by pressing the touch screen again you can select the desired exhibit.
There you get a short note about the selected exhibit. This note could be a description, a
comment or an anecdote. Below the heading, “Reading” (“Lesen”) visitors can view an image
of the exhibit in the M3. They can select its transcript, if they cannot read the handwriting.
Below the heading, “Connected” (“Vernetzt”) they can connect with other exhibits in “nexus”
from the same author, year or issue. The provided M3 information is changed according to the
exhibit exchange that is conducted every six months. Additional German guided tours about
different issues are available as well as general ones in English and in French (Strittmatter
2012: 336-345 about the M3).
The fourth ‘m’ in Marbach is the “Mensch” (human being); hence, the museum attendants are
especially helpful in handling the M3 menu. The museum attendants provide a short
introduction on how to operate the M3 and how to understand the concept of “nexus”.
Accordingly, the museum attendants probably make a strong contribution to understanding
“nexus” and to overcoming the operation barriers of the M3. Besides the M3 and the museum
attendants, so-called “Cicerons”, specialized staff for museum education and German
literature, conduct guided tours (Gfrereis 2007: 3).
Whereas the catalogue Denkbilder und Schaustücke: Das Literaturmuseum der Moderne
(Mental Images and Showpieces: the Museum of Modern Literature) is not a usual catalogue
explaining and contextualizing the exhibition or the museum, it is rather a literary approach in
6 notions and 35 showpieces. The notions are essays about literary exhibits in this new
museum and its relation to the archive in Marbach. The showpieces are various kinds of texts
by famous authors about one personally selected exhibit from “nexus” (cf. Gfrereis & Raulff
2006: 9-10).
86

•

The Visitors

Who are the visitors of “nexus”? Since its opening in 2006 until 2012 approximately 237,437
visitors viewed the exhibitions at the LiMo. The LiMo is not located in the shopping mall of a
famous metropolis but rather in a rural area next to state capital of Baden-Württemberg:
Stuttgart. Who is visiting “nexus” then? Although the head of the museum, Heike Gfrereis,
stresses that the visitors do not have to be experts (Gfrereis 2009: 5), Marbach’s visitors are
mostly experts and enthusiasts who travel to Marbach in order to view the archival materials
and to explore them more deeply or even to conduct research about them. The LiMo is
deliberately built in Marbach because the archive is there (Gfrereis 2009: 3).
The report by Melanie Waldheim about her summative evaluation conducted at the LiMo
from 9th -21st June 2007 verifies that:
•

Most visitors are between 15 and 29 years old or over 59 years (whereas children
under 15 years old had not been evaluated)

•

58% are academics (hence comparing to Klein’s (1990) research at other museums the
LiMo visitors are a highly qualified)

•

52% are female

•

56% are from the country Baden-Württemberg where Marbach is located

•

81% are reading books daily or many times a week (hence LiMo visitors are reading
visitors)

•

11% are repeating visitors of the whole DLA

More results characterizing the visitors of my MET study in the “nexus” exhibition will
follow in Chapter 6.

3.3. Comments on the Comparability of the Two Exhibitions
These two exhibitions are very different. They are different in regard to their modes
(temporary versus permanent exhibition); particular presentation styles of displaying objects
(freestanding and display cabinets versus only display cabinets; front-glass display cabinets
versus completely glassy display cabinets; a mixture of heterogeneous and homogenous
display cabinets versus only almost completely homogenous display cabinets) and modes of
implementing different digital guides (audio guide versus tablet guide) in correspondence
with the particular intentions of the curators. Furthermore, the two exhibitions are placed in
87

institutions that are very different in terms of their histories and buildings (old versus newly
established) and last but not least with regard to their subject matter.
Nevertheless, precisely because these two exhibitions are different, they represent a great
spectrum of typical museum exhibitions. Due to these differences, the great amount of 26
movement patterns and sub patterns presented in Chapters 4-6 could be identified. Hence, the
differences between the exhibitions did not negatively affect the research aim that seeks new
insights into the micro level of eye movement patterns; instead, these differences are the most
important assets for gaining a broader spectrum of eye movement patterns.
Furthermore, as the reader will see in Chapters 4-6 the visitor samples are heterogeneous as
well. Again this is not negative for the research aims instead the heterogeneous samples are
representative for usual visitors in museums. Therefore, the research results are even more
valid.
In the end, despite the differences between the exhibitions there is one common feature that is
very crucial in the context of movement patterns, namely that both exhibitions avoid
suggesting a single or main pathway for visitors. Hence, the comparability between the two
MET studies is given in regard to the explorative free-viewing task that was requested of the
visitors.

Mobile Eye Tracking and Cued Retrospective Reporting – Part One: The Results of
the First Visitor Study at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart

This chapter is the core of this thesis. It provides the results of the explorative mobile eye
tracking (MET) field study combined with cued retrospective reporting (CRR) in the
temporary “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the
Linden-Museum in Stuttgart in 2010.
The main aim was to identify visitors’ movement patterns from their own perspective or so to
speak their emic point of view in its very literal sense. Therefore, I applied MET as a new
complementary method in visitor studies and socio-cultural anthropology. With observation
and tracking studies, many research results were already reported about visitor circulation
through exhibitions. However, with MET we can move a step further to the micro level of eye
movement behaviour at one single exhibit or one single display cabinet. Thus, the main aim
was to determine whether there are distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns to
appropriate exhibitions. Thereby the previous findings by Treinen (1988) “cultural window
shopping”, Aleida Assmann (1995) “long gaze” and Mayr et al. (2009) first insights in
alternating and orientating gazes serve as the starting point of my investigation. Another
important aim was to elicit the accompanying cognitive processes in viewing exhibitions by
combining MET with CRR.
Besides the main aims, I will answer further questions in this chapter such as the following:
Firstly, what do the distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns look like? What
movements of the head, the trunk and the body do these eye movement patterns entail?
Hence, how do visitors appropriate exhibitions by their body? Is it true that orientation plays
such a crucial role as it can be concluded by the interaction approach of Bitgood (2006) and
Rounds (2004) and as it was declared by Mayr et al. (2009)? Do these movement patterns and
the applied MET shape the museum experience? This chapter demonstrates that the
movement patterns form the basis of the visitors’ museum experience. Later on, Chapter 7
reports about the influence of the MET on the visitors’ experience.
Secondly, MET may allow us to make detailed reports about particular affordances (Gibson
1979; see Chapter 2) of single exhibits or single display cabinets. Are there difference
between freestanding exhibits and display cabinets? Do display cabinets limit the action
possibilities as one can conclude with Norman (2013, see Chapter 2)? Norman (2013: 11)
defines the limitation of walking through glass as an “anti-affordance – the prevention of
interaction”. Do we need additional “signifiers” (Norman 2013) in exhibitions?
89

Thirdly, besides the affordances of exhibition and hence design factors, a minor aim was to
compare content experts with novices concerning the movement patterns and cognitive
processes. Do experts and novices differ in their viewing behaviours and why? Is the
interaction approach represented by Bitgood (2006) and Rounds (2004) right that exhibition
visits are characterized by a combination of design factors and personal visitor factors?
In sum, with MET in combination with CRR we can collect unconscious data about the
museum experience and appropriation of visitors. On this basis, we can draw conclusions
about how to design even these smallest parts of an exhibition more deliberately. Thus, in the
end, I can provide a comprehensive system of design suggestions for exhibition makers
related to particular movement patterns and based on the theory of affordances by Gibson
(1979), which is lacking so far.
The influence of the digital guide in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western
Pacific” exhibition – an audio guide by Tonwelt (see Chapter 3) – was not investigated in this
MET study. Due to the sensitive calibration of the MET device that is mounted on the
visitors’ head the audio guide usage was excluded in this study avoiding slip outs of the MET
position.
MET in visitor studies is a fairly new method as demonstrated in Chapter 1. Mayr et al.
(2009) conducted a single MET study that consisted of an exhibition set up solely for the
purposes of exploring MET with three participants (Mayr et al. 2009). I now report on
research in a setting that was natural in the sense that the case study was carried out at a
museum with regular exhibitions that were set up by curators with conventional training in
their field and for regular visitors who frequent these museums. Putting MET at work in these
“wild” conditions is a more realistic test case of this tool for interested field researchers.
This chapter is structured in five paragraphs: firstly, an introduction into the field study;
secondly, a general description of the movement patterns; thirdly, general results of the CRR;
fourthly, an individual description of movement patterns and the accompanying CRR of one
expert and one novice at the four selected sections within the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition and lastly, a summarizing conclusion containing
design suggestions.

4.1. The Mobile Eye Tracking Field Study at the Linden-Museum
Now, I will describe the research process and the research results of the explorative MET field
study in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the
Linden-Museum in Stuttgart in 2010. The exhibition was described in detail in Chapter 3.
Now, I will go into details about the preparation, the participating visitors, the procedure and
the data analysis.

4.1.1. Preparation
Before the study could be conducted, I had to learn how to use and calibrate the MET and I had
to find visitors without corneal dysfunctions. Remember that persons with corneal dysfunctions
could not be tracked by the MET. For a technical description of MET read Chapter 1,
paragraph 1.3.

4.1.2. Participating Visitors
The sample size included eight participating visitors: four “experts” (persons with prior
knowledge of the subject matter, e.g., students of cultural anthropology) and four “novices”
(persons with only cursory or even no prior knowledge of the subject matter and with no
knowledge about museology, museum education or exhibition design). To control for technical
problems, more than eight visitors took part in the study in order to achieve the planned sample
of eight visitors. In Table 2 the basic information about the sample is summarized:

Sample of the MET Study in the "South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific" Exhibition: Visitors' Social Data

All participants were German-speaking and visited the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in
the Western Pacific” exhibition for the first time and had no prior knowledge about this
exhibition or how to navigate through it. All participants declared that they generally behaved
as usual.

4.1.3. Procedure
I

applied

the

ASL

MobileEye

eye

tracker

(designed

2004;

http://www.asleyetracking.com/Site/Products/MobileEye/tabid/70/Default.aspx) for the MET
field study at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart in 2010 (see Figures 1 and 2 in Chapter 1).
I applied MET in an exploratory fashion, to help document and analyse the movement
patterns of visitors, i.e., what visitors “really” looked at as they moved freely through the
exhibition. According to Land and Tatler (2009: 41), “free-viewing” allows the participant “to
select their own high-level approaches to looking at scenes”. Consequently, by recording free
viewing in as much detail as possible, I was aiming to find their implicit scripts and strategies
or what one may consider their natural, habitual way of appropriating exhibitions. Thereby I
presumed that the characteristics of the displayed exhibits and the design of the exhibition
sections create particular affordances to which the visitor viewing behaviours correspond (cf.
Chapter 2 for the ‘theory of affordances’ by Gibson 1979). All participants received the
following open and standardized instructions for their exhibition visit after calibrating the
MET: “Please view the exhibition naturally at your own speed, following your own wishes
and needs. There are no further specifications, not even a time specification for how to carry
out this visit. Your knowledge acquisition about the exhibition will not be tested afterwards”.
Since I wanted to find out what the participants actually attended to during their visit, we used
CRR to elicit their goals of attention, avoiding priming effects as much as possible. After the
exhibition visit, all participants were asked to watch their own processed eye-tracking video
and to verbalize with this cue in retrospect. At that stage, I gave the following standardized
instruction: “Now I present you the video recorded by the MET during your visit of the
exhibition. While watching the video, please describe spontaneously what you viewed,
perceived, thought and felt at various points and what you paid attention to”.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Leibniz Knowledge Media
Research Centre in Tuebingen, Germany.

4.1.4. Analysis
Before the data analysis could take place, the eye movement recordings were transformed into
AVI files and later into smaller MP4 files for presentation on DVDs. Furthermore before the
MET videos could be analysed, they had to be synchronized with the reporting that was done
in retrospection according to the video cue. At last, I had one video without audio and one
with audio for all participants. Due to the time limit of the special exhibition “South Sea
Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” the data analysis was conducted in several
phases.

Phase one:
Phase one of MET data analysis was conducted directly after data collection but before the
systematic observation study was conducted (see Chapter 5). Firstly, I watched the whole
video of the visitor E1 in natural speed without audio and with rewind option looking for
recurrences, systematics and peculiarities in eye movements thereby writing a chronological
protocol of movements. Secondly, I watched the whole video of the visitor E1 in natural
speed but this time with audio and rewinding to look for recurrences, systematics and
peculiarities in eye movements and the visitor’s particular reporting thereby writing a
chronological protocol of movements and issues. Thirdly, I organized and classified these two
protocols into issues and movements. Fourthly, I watched randomly selected parts of all other
MET videos in natural speed across all other participants with and without audio and again
with rewind option looking for further recurrences, systematics and peculiarities in eye
movements and their particular reporting. Note that the MET videos were not yet cut
according to the sections at this time. Then I completed the list of issues and movements. In
sum, I identified 15 distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns in this first phase of
analysis.
The movement patterns identified in the first phase of analysis were defined and
operationalized so that I was able to successfully confirm them with systematic observation.
Due to their different affordances four sections within the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition were selected (see Chapter 5). These sections
were described in Chapter 3:

94

Section 1: The Men’s House Model from Palau
Section 2: The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap
Section 3: The Homogenous Display Cabinet
Section 4: The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet

Phase two:
After the systematic observation study was conducted (see Chapter 5), the second phase of
MET data analysis began. Now, I analysed the MET video sequences at the four selected
sections. Therefore, I cut the MET videos according to the selected sections. Then I watched
the videos in natural speed without audio and with rewind option looking for the frequency of
the 15 movement patterns identified in phase one, additionally I was looking for further
recurrences, systematics and peculiarities. Three further movement patterns were identified in
this second phase of analysis. Hence, in sum I identified 18 movement patterns in the MET
study in “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition. Thereby I
give no claims to completeness as I assume that further movement patterns will be identified
in other exhibitions.

Phase three:
In this phase, I conducted a content analysis of the CRR based on the list of reported issues
developed in phase one (see paragraph 4.3.).

Phase four:
Then I analysed the videos with audio for one expert and one novice to provide examples of
movement patterns and the accompanying cognitive processing demonstrated in the CRR (see
paragraph 4.4.). Therefore, the prototypical examples were selected due to the following
criteria:
-

Differences between visitor groups (single expert versus single novice)

-

Typical contrasting examples

-

Demonstrate several movement patterns
95

Hence, I selected one expert (E1) and one novice (N1) as representatives.

Phase five:
At last, I interpreted the 18 movement patterns regarding their possible functions and
classified them into four different tasks, which are orientation, strolling around and
involvement with exhibits and social interaction with other human beings.

This chapter reports the results of all five phases of analysis. Unfortunately, the video quality
of the ASL Mobile Eye was poor. Nevertheless, the quality was good enough to detect the
distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns. For a critical reflection about the
methods and technologies read Chapter 7.

4.2.

General Description of Movement Patterns

This section will provide a general description of the movement patterns. Hence, it includes
my general definition of the term (eye) movement patterns and a general description of the 18
movement patterns with links to examples on a DVD. Furthermore it provides the frequencies
of each movement patterns across the four selected sections, the total numbers of movement
patterns at each section and for experts and novices as well as a comparison between experts
and novices at section 3 (“The Homogenous Display Cabinet”) within the “South Sea Oases:
Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in 2010.

4.2.1. General Definition of Movement Patterns
First, why do I call these movement patterns ‘(eye) movement patterns’ and not gaze patterns
or scan patterns or scan paths?
Firstly, I term them “patterns” because I want to stress the anthropological approach of
cultural relativism represented by Ruth Benedict. She (1934/2005: 46) asserts in her
revolutionary book Patterns of Culture: “A culture, like an individual, is a more or less
consistent pattern of thought and action”. Museum visits are part of so-called particular
incorporated and learned cultural patterns in parts of our society as Bourdieu appropriately
96

pointed out in The Love of Art (1969/1997). Hence, viewing patterns are probably different
across cultures. The psychologist Nisbett and his colleagues demonstrated the first empirical
evidence based on eye tracking for this so-called culture-cognition connection in attention
processes (Chua, Boland & Nisbett 2005). In their article Cultural Variation in Eye
Movements during Scene Perception, they apply eye tracking for figuring out differences in
movement patterns between Chinese and European/American graduate students viewing
pictures. These reported differences in fixations and saccades make it evident that scene
perception is culturally shaped because, as discussed in Chapter 1, eye movements are
unconscious and can hardly be manipulated. Hence as a socio-cultural anthropologist I have
to assume that the movement patterns I figured out (see below) are probably culturaldependent and have to be proven cross-culturally as well.
Secondly, I initially termed them “(eye) movements” with ‘eye’ in brackets because I want to
stress that these patterns could be performed not only solely with the eyes but also with the
head, the trunk or even the whole body in a three-dimensional space.
Thirdly, I initially termed them “(eye) movements” with ‘eye’ in brackets because I want to
confirm them with observation, and with external observation, I have to deduce these patterns
from observable movements of the head, the trunk or the whole body (for a critical reflection
about the methods see Chapter 7).
Fourthly, I term them “(eye) movements” because this three-dimensional space, a museum
gallery, is characterized by appropriation via “strolling and viewing” (“gehen und sehen”
Korff & Thiemeyer 2008: 137; cf. Korff 2003) mostly due to the fact that haptic experiences
are usually rare in exhibitions or even excluded in my visitor research. As mentioned above
visitors can ‘touch’ exhibits with their gaze, because they can read labels and text panels as
well as view exhibits and even entire exhibitions themselves by performing particular
movement patterns. These different forms of movement patterns belong to different
affordances of the different exhibits and display cabinets, which likely shapes the museum
experience.

97

4.2.2. Description of Particular Movement Patterns
The movement patterns will be described in a list below. This list contains the definition,
presumed functions without giving claims of completeness, examples of accompanying
cognitive processes and links to a DVD with video examples of the 18 movement patterns
without audio and with audio reporting to demonstrate the accompanying cognitive processes.
This list is the result of all phases of analysis described above.
The 15 movement patterns in bold print were identified in the first phase of analysis. The
three movement patterns in italic and bold print were identified in the second phase of
analysis. Note that these movement patterns are not part of the descriptive statistics as these
movement patterns were identified later on in the process of analysis.
The discovery of movement patterns varied: some movement patterns really popped out of the
video material like the “Insight” that is described as visitors are looking inside an exhibit that
has an opening. The visitors themselves described some movement patterns, such as the
“Major Orientation Gaze” that is performed when entering a new gallery.
Other movement patterns were described firstly as a sequence of movements and are
classified as one movement pattern later on. For example, the “Changing Perspective”
movement pattern is described as viewing one exhibit from different perspectives in the three
dimensional gallery. Here, I will describe how I identified the movement pattern “Changing
Perspective” in order to provide an example of how I identified the movement patterns in
general. The “Changing Perspective” movement pattern was identified in the first phase of
analysis. I first noticed this pattern while watching a video sequence of a female visitor
viewing the masks that were hung at the back wall of Gallery 3 “Deities and Spirits” (see
Figure 10). As mentioned above I firstly watched the videos without audio. I watched how
this female visitor firstly approached the right mask more closely, hence she moved with her
completely body towards this mask. Secondly, she viewed the mask from the front. Thirdly,
she moved her body to see behind the mask. In the end, she moved backwards to look at the
front of the mask once again. In the next step, I watched the video with audio. The reporting
in retrospection at this mask proved that this sequence of movements belong together. The
visitor reported that she was interested “how the mask was hung”. Further video sequences
demonstrated that these movements form one particular movement pattern. Figure 50 and 51
show a “Changing Perspective” movement pattern at a hanging comb within “The
Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”. This proves that it does not matter, if the exhibits are
98

presented within a display cabinet or freestanding. The relevant factor is, if the exhibit is
presented hanging or not. In the end, after several samples I was able to define the sequence
of movements that are performed to view a hanging exhibit from different perspectives as the
“Changing Perspective” movement pattern. This movement pattern is a parade example for
the viewing possibilities in a three-dimensional exhibition space in contrast to viewing a TV
or computer screen presenting pictures and movies.
Other movement patterns are based on previous research such as “Window Shopping”
(Treinen 1988), or “Long Gaze” (Aleida Assmann 1995) or “Alternating Gaze” and gazes for
orientation and overview that were either named as such or described already by Mayr et al.
(2009). These movement patterns were already described in Chapter 2, paragraph 2.2.
Appropriation in Museum Exhibitions.
The examples of the accompanying cognitive processes identified in the CRR are the results
of the third phase; typical examples are provided below. As a last step, I interpreted these
movement patterns as task-oriented patterns and I classified them into four categories
indicated by asterisks (*):
Movement Patterns and Orientation*
Movement Patterns and Strolling**
Movement Patterns and Exhibits***
Movement Patterns and Human Beings****

List of Movement Patterns in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western
Pacific” Exhibition
First, note that this list is incomplete. Further movement patterns were identified in the
“nexus” exhibition at the LiMo. All movement patterns are reciprocally excluded.

99

1) Movement Patterns and Orientation*
•

Major Orientation Gaze (cf. Mayr et al. 2009; see Chapter 2)
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one point or walks slowly and looks around thereby the visitor
moves her eyes and her head in order to view a greater part of the gallery. Possibly,
she also moves her trunk and body. This movement pattern serves to orientate oneself
initially in a three-dimensional space/gallery or a greater part of a three dimensional
space/gallery.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
N1 at the beginning of the exhibition:
“Firstly, I had to orientate myself”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Orientation > Major Orientation Gaze

•

Minor Orientation Gaze (cf. Mayr et al. 2009; see Chapter 2)
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one point or walks slowly and looks around thereby the visitor
moves her eyes and possibly her head and trunk in order to view a smaller part of the
gallery. This movement pattern serves to orientate oneself in a smaller part of a threedimensional space like one part of a gallery (one exhibit, one display cabinet, an
ensemble of paintings, one installation, one diorama, one text panel) in order to get an
overview.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
E4 at section 3 “The Homogenous Display Cabinet”:
“Are they appreciated highly?”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Orientation > Minor Orientation Gaze

100

•

Backward Gaze
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one point of the three dimensional gallery space and turns back
her head or possibly her trunk and body in order to view a part of the gallery she
already viewed before. This is a short movement backwards and forwards again. This
movement pattern is probably performed to compare new information with older
information.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
E1 at section 4 “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”:
“Ah, yes, exactly, at that moment I, exactly, till that moment I wondered what the
structure (of the exhibition is like)”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Orientation > Backward Gaze

•

Forward Gaze
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one point of the three dimensional gallery space and turns her
head or possibly her trunk in order to view a part of the gallery ahead or besides her
which she has not yet viewed in detail before. This is a short movement forwards and
backwards again. This movement pattern is probably performed to look for new
issues.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
N5 at section 4”The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”:
“Or no, now firstly again away, apparently not yet”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Orientation > Forward Gaze

101

2) Movement Patterns and Strolling**
•

Window Shopping (based on Treinen 1988; see Chapter 2)
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor walks along one display cabinet and moves her head and possibly partially
or completely her trunk at the side of the display cabinet while walking along it. This
movement pattern is performed to view display cases while walking along it probably
to get “only” the gist of the display.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
N1 at section 3 “The Homogenous Display Cabinet”:
“Yes, textiles, quick way through”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Strolling > Window Shopping

•

Wandering Along
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor walks along a freestanding exhibit, moves her head and may mover her
trunk possibly partially or completely to one side of the exhibit while walking along it.
This pattern is similar to “Window Shopping”. The only difference is that “Window
Shopping” is performed at a window, hence a display cabinet, and “Wandering
Along” is performed at freestanding exhibits that are not placed in a display cabinet.
This movement pattern is performed to view a freestanding exhibit while walking
along or around it probably to get “only” the gist of a display.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
E1 at section 1 “The Men’s House Model from Palau”:
“Right, what was it? One – I think – one rooster, or? That was on it or even many;
here along the bottom”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Strolling > Wandering Along

102

•

Turn
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands or walks and turns with her whole body into a different direction
then the one she walked or stood before. This movement patterns is connected to
movement patterns of orientation and alternation.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
N2 at section 2 “The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap”:
“I do that again because I am also interested in that picture or rather exhibit”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Strolling > Turn

•

Fixation Walk
Definition and presumed possible functions:
This gaze starts while standing or walking. Then the visitor fixates one exhibit/display
cabinet/diorama/installation/text panel etc. from far away and walks straight to it
moving her body without moving her head. This movement patterns is probably
performed to issues and exhibits that attract visitors even from far away. This
movement patterns is probably connected (not only but also) to landmark objects.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
E2 at section 2 “The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap”:
“Right, I think now, right there are the pictures: about the people who
(AFTERWARDS: built that ship. Then I had to think of a book by Nigel Barley – how
was it called again? – “Hello Mr. Puttyman”, where he conducted research in
Indonesia, brought a group of people to England afterwards and let them build a rice
house – I do not know what kind of house it was anymore – in the national museum.
DEEP BREATH I don’t know what my opinion is on that)”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Strolling > Fixation Walk

103

3) Movement Patterns and Exhibits***
•

Reading Text Panel
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one point and reads the text panel therefore; she moves her eyes
and possibly her head. This movement pattern is performed to gain

further

information.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
E1 at section 4 “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”:
“Still reading text and (E1 laughs and claps his hands) come on – (BREAK) – Right,
somewhere it is mentioned in the text that these combs are readily decorated with
feathers also. I am not sure anymore, I think, (feathers) from the frigate bird”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Exhibits > Reading Text Panel

•

Reading Labels
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one point and reads labels therefore, she moves her eyes. This
movement pattern is performed to gain further information about one particular
exhibit.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
E4 at section 4 “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”:
“Ah, right, I found that exciting also, there it was written ‘women’s money’, these flat
bowls”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Exhibits > Reading Labels

•

Long Gaze (based on Aleida Assmann 1995; see Chapter 2)
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands or sits down and views one exhibit for a long time (at least 3
seconds or even longer) without moving her head or body and without moving her
eyes too much. Assmann (1995) describes this gaze as a “fascinated gaze” that

stares
104

contemplatively at the materiality of the world without transforming it (into
knowledge).
This pattern could be classified differently in the MET study than in the observation
study because generally the eye moves in a zigzag fashion and does not stop moving
for such a long time (see Chapter 1). The external observer could miss other
movement patterns that are performed solely with the eyes, because the observer can
only observe head and body movements (more about the pros and cons of these two
methods in Chapter 7).
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
N4 at section 2 “The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap”:
(BEFORE: “And there were two big pictures where the boat was presented in action
so to speak. I found that left picture very beautiful – it looked really like holidays.)
Yes, exactly this one“
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Exhibits > Long Gaze

•

Insight
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands and looks inside an exhibit with an opening that is displayed close
to the front wall of a display cabinet or freestanding. Therefore, firstly she moves
likely her trunk and her head towards an aperture of the exhibit; hence firstly, performs
a “Zooming Closer” in order to have a look inside, secondly. This movement pattern is
probably performed due to curiosity and interest about the inside part of an exhibit.
During an “Insight”, other movement patterns are possible at the same time. Therefore,
only the insight is classified in the analysis and the parallel movement patterns have
not been classified because the insight is in the foreground.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
N1 at section 1 “Men’s House Model from Palau”:

105

“There one can view an indentation in the floor. Well, it is poorly visible in the film
now, but there is an indentation in the house”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Exhibits > Insight

•

Changing Perspective
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one hanging exhibit (freestanding or in a display cabinet) and
moves her head and/or trunk to view the exhibit from different perspectives.
Alternatively, the visitor walks a bit around a freestanding exhibit thereby moving her
body and head to view the exhibit from different perspectives. This pattern is the
parade example of movement patterns in a three-dimensional space. It is probably
performed due to curiosity about viewing a hanging exhibit from multiple
perspectives.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
E1 at section 4 “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”:
“This one I viewed a tick longer. And shortly back again to the comb, right then I
wondered how this, this, I think it was a bone…”
Later on while viewing the head inchworm:
“…this part where there was a decoration element, where the wing is attached, with a
grasp of the comb or well it is not a grasp at all, it is some kind of shaft because
actually the comb was stuck into the hair, how these are fixed together, tied up with
each other”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Exhibits > Changing Perspective

106

•

Object Scan
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands or walks and scans with her eyes the shape of an exhibit or part of a
bigger exhibit thereby moving solely her eyes or eyes and head and possibly her
trunk/whole body as well. This movement pattern is probably performed to realise the
(dimension of the) whole exhibit or part of a bigger exhibit.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
N2 at section 2 “The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap”:
“How the people sat down on it?”
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Exhibits > Object Scan

•

Alternating Gaze
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one point and moves her eyes and possibly her head and her trunk
quickly back and forth (i) between an exhibit and its label or (ii) between a text panel
and exhibits or (iii) between two different exhibits either freestanding or placed in a
display cabinet).
Again, this is a movement pattern that could be classified differently by observation or
MET analysis because eye movements that are done without head and body
movements are not observable by an external observer (more about the pros and cons
of these two methods in Chapter 7). This movement pattern is probably performed to
compare exhibits or combine information about exhibits with exhibits. Mayr et al.
(2009: 116) already described “alternate fixation of objects” for “semantic information
or information about design”.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
(i)

Label_Exhibit:

N4 at section 4 “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”:
“And that money, well these are gemstones”
107

(ii)

Text Panel_Exhibit:

E1 at section 4 “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”:
“Yes then I know at least what it is about”
(iii)

Between Exhibits:

N4 at section 4 “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”; several alternating gazes in
succession):
“Admittedly I don’t know anymore what it was, but there were feathers from such a
frigate bird and they were curled and I found that totally…I never saw that before that
is why I looked at it carefully”
MET Video Examples:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Exhibits > Alternating Gazes

•

Zooming Closer
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one exhibit (freestanding or in a display cabinet) and zooms
closer therefore her head and trunk move forward to the exhibit. This movement
pattern is probably performed to have a closer look. “Zooming Closer” and “Insights”
are connected with each other.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
N4 at section 3 “Homogenous Display Cabinet”:
“…long. That’s why I looked up because I wanted to see how long they are”.
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Exhibits > Zooming Closer

•

Zooming Further Afar
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor stands at one exhibit (freestanding or in a display cabinet) and zooms
further afar therefore her head and trunk move backward from the exhibit or even her
whole body. This movement pattern is performed to view the exhibit from a
distance/further afar.
108

Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
E4 at section 3 “Homogenous Display Cabinet” (no report while Zooming Further
Afar but shortly before she reported):
“Here one can see very nicely how this was woven. I appreciate that this (weaving
example) was presented so that it was possible to imagine how these are made. And it
looks like a lot of work”.
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Exhibits > Zooming Further Afar

4) Movement Patterns and Human Beings****
•

Social Gaze
Definition and presumed possible functions:
The visitor moves either solely her eyes or additionally her head, her trunk, or even
her whole body towards other human beings. Social Gazes are gazes to other human
beings, be it other visitors or museum attendants etc. They are probably performed due
to curiosity, interest or because the attention on exhibits is interrupted by the
appearance of other human beings.
Example of Cognitive Processes (CRR-Protocols):
E2 at section 1 “Men’s House Model from Palau”:
“Right, there are the two with their audio guides”.
MET Video Example:
DVD: MET Linden-Museum 2010_KEA > Human Beings > Social Gaze

This list demonstrates the variability and particularities of the visitors’ viewing behaviours
from their own perspective, their native’s point of viewing exhibitions.

4.2.3. Frequencies of Movement Patterns
Due to the explorative approach, technical problems and exhausted visitors (see Chapter 7),
there are not full samples of participating visitors at each section. Thus, I can draw only
109

cautious conclusions about the affordances of each section and the suggestions for deliberate
exhibition design in providing the frequencies of the 15 movement patterns figured out in the
second phase of analysis. As a reminder, I only provide the frequencies of the 15 movement
patterns and not all 18 movement patterns for reasons of comparability with the observation
study presented in Chapter 5. This observation study was conducted in between the first phase
of MET data analysis that identified 15 movement patterns and the second phase that analysed
the frequencies of the first 15 movement patterns and identified three further ones.

•

Comparison of (Eye) Movement Patterns Frequencies across All Four Sections

As Table 3 shows, some movement patterns were more often performed than others. There
seems to be a ranking of more or less frequently performed movement patterns. Thus, some
affordances are more likely perceived as other affordances. Hence, some affordances are more
subtle or silent, whereas some are more stuck out. The movement patterns can be grouped in
four categories. These four categories are defined by frequencies into most frequent (≥ 20),
frequent (19-10), less frequent (9-1) and none (0).
Note that although the duration is not evaluated, these frequencies correlate with a certain
amount of time for performing each movement pattern. Because certainly one cannot not view
the exhibition. Thus, the performance of more frequent movement patterns also means a
longer duration at the respective section. Furthermore, note that these frequencies are
aggregated frequency rates across all participating visitors. Thus, I do not concentrate on
single visitors but on particular movement patterns that were evoked by particular perceived
affordances. The frequency rates of the movement patterns thus tell us which affordances are
more likely to be perceived and reacted onto.

Movement Patterns and Orientation*
•

Major Orientation Gaze:
“Major Orientation Gazes” are performed rarely or never. This pattern is rather performed
when entering a gallery/room. Nevertheless, all the selected sections are not at the
entrance of a new gallery.

•

Minor Orientation Gaze:
Obviously, “Minor Orientation Gazes” are the most frequent movement patterns.
Orientation in a smaller part of the exhibition seems to be an important issue for museum
visitors to navigate through exhibitions and select exhibits for a more detailed
appropriation.

•

Backward Gaze:
“Backward Gazes” are not as important for orientation as “Minor Orientation Gazes”.
This phenomenon is probably part of the avoidance of backtracking in circulation through
a gallery as reported by Bitgood (2006; see Chapter 1).

Movement Patterns and Strolling**
•

Window Shopping
As Treinen (1988) already presumed correctly, display cabinets invite active snoozing and
are often walked along without carefully viewing the exhibits within them. The length of a
display cabinet seems to play a crucial role. Hence, if one wants visitors to perform less
“Window Shopping” the display cabinet should be shorter.

•

Wandering Along
“Wandering Along”, hence walking along a display cabinet without looking at it is
performed seldom. As I will show exemplarily later on, it seems as if “Window
Shopping” and “Wandering Along” are enough to get the gist of the displayed exhibits.

•

Turn
“Turns” are performed more often than other patterns of strolling like “Window
Shopping” or “Wandering Along”. “Turns” seem to be connected with orientation and
“Alternating Gazes”. Hence, they are performed more often. A heterogeneous display
cabinet seems to minimize “Turns”, probably because there are enough new exhibits to
explore on the way along it. Therefore, less “Turns” are necessary. Thus “Turns” are a
112

good example that “saving steps” as a principle (Bitgood 2006) cannot explain every
phenomenon encountered in exhibitions.

Movement Patterns and Exhibits***
•

Reading Text Panel
“Reading Text Panels” is performed more often, if the text panel is put closely to the
respective exhibits. Thus, the conclusion for text panels is easy. Put it as close as possible
to the related exhibits.

•

Reading Labels
“Reading Labels” is more often performed than “Reading Text Panels”, probably because
there are more labels than text panels. Apart from that, it seems that a heterogeneous
presentation leads to more label reading than a homogenous presentation.

•

Long Gaze
Although photo shows on screens and special exhibits like the weaving example certainly
invite visitors to perform “Long Gazes”, a heterogeneous presentation invites “Long
Gazes” the most. Hence, a heterogeneous presentation puts original exhibits in the middle
of visitors’ attention.

•

Insight
If exhibition makers want visitors to get a look inside an exhibit, they must present it
freestanding or at least close to the front-wall of a display cabinet.

•

Changing Perspective
Although freestanding exhibits provide more options for viewing the three dimensions of
an exhibit, “Changing Perspective” seems to be rather connected with hanging exhibits.
“The Homogenous Display Cabinet” presented many exhibits hanging. Hence changing
perspective is more often performed than at the other sections. “Changing Perspective” is
a good example of one of the most important and distinguishing features that characterizes
an exhibition visit compared to other mass media: the ability to go off and to explore in
multiple possible ways and from a number of perspectives.

•

Object Scan
“Object Scans” seem to be performed at long lines of an exhibit, especially if the exhibit
has a huge size like “The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap”.
113

•

Alternating Gaze
“Alternating Gazes” seem to be more possible and important for comparisons between
exhibits, exhibits and their labels and exhibits and text panels displayed in display
cabinets than for the single freestanding exhibits.

•

Zooming Closer
As one might expect display cabinets limit “Zooming Closer”, but obviously do not
prevent it. In contrast, even more “Zooming Closer” is performed at display cabinets.
Maybe the limitation of the display cabinet not only provides security for the exhibits but
also for the visitors.

Movement Patterns and Human Beings***
•

Social Gaze
“Social Gazes” are not connected with the affordances of the exhibit or the exhibition but
with the occurrence of other people being around. “Social Gazes” are performed only
rarely. One reason might be that only a few other museum visitors were around. Another
reason might be the perception of other human beings in the periphery of the eye that is
not captured by the single lens camera. Another reason might be the perception of other
human beings by other senses like hearing them. An additional reason might be the taskoriented and socially desirable behaviour of the studied museum visitors viewing the
exhibition and not human beings and because a museum visit is about “things” rather than
about other “human beings” around.

Other Movement Patterns
Note that this big residual category “Other Movement Patterns” is connected to the different
phases of analysis. This category includes all movement patterns identified in the second
phase of analysis when I looked for the frequencies of the 15 movement patterns of phase one
and occurrences of further movement patterns. Thus, the category “Other Movement Patterns”
includes the three movement patterns: “Forward Gaze”, “Fixation Walk” and “Zooming
Further Afar”. For a more detailed description of movement, pattern frequencies at each
section please read the appendices 10.2.

Table 4: Total numbers of movement patterns at each section of the “South Sea Oases: Life

The comparison of the total numbers of movement patterns across all four sections (see Table
4) shows that although firstly, the samples are not full and small anyway, and secondly, there
is a relation between the size of an exhibit/display cabinet and the frequency of movement
patterns, there is an evident difference between the display cabinets (section 3 see Figure 25
and section 4 see Figure 26) and the freestanding exhibits (section 1 see Figures 19-21 and
section 2 see Figures 23 and 24). More movement patterns are performed at the display
cabinets. This is rather surprising because due to the display in display cabinets one would
suppose that there is less affordance compared to freestanding exhibits. Nevertheless, it rather
seems that although exhibits are displayed behind glass walls of display cabinets, it is possible
to explore, appropriate them in a great variability. Probably the limitation of the display
cabinet due to its walls not only provides security for the exhibits but also for the visitors. Due
to this feeling or affordance of security might lead to a more relaxed and hence multi-faceted
appropriation by particular movement patterns. These assumptions need further empirical
validation in future visitor studies.
Another difference exists between “The Homogenous Display Cabinet” (section 3 see Figure
25) and “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet” (section 4 see Figure 26): more movement
patterns are performed at the display cabinet showing a broad range of different exhibits. First
of all this result corresponds to the length of the display cabinet but secondly, the frequency
115

rates are too different to be just corresponding to the length of the display cabinets. Hence, it
seems that a heterogeneous class of exhibits leads to more possible affordances and hence to
more active visitor behaviour than a homogeneous class of exhibits in display cabinets. In
sum: active visitor behaviours depend on the kind of presentation within a display cabinet.

As there are not full samples for each condition and the samples are very small anyway (see
Table 5), I only can speak of a possible tendency that experts presumably perform more
movement patterns than novices. Hence, it seems that experts are more active visitors than
novices.
As there are only full samples at section 3, “The Homogenous Display Cabinet”, I will
compare the different groups (experts vs. novices) here exemplarily:

Table 6: MET Study results – Comparison of Movement Patterns Distribution Section 3
(The Homogenous Display Cabinet) between Experts and Novices of the “South Sea Oases:
Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” Exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart

As in the general comparison of frequencies regarding experts and novices at each section, the
same is valid for section 3 (“The Homogenous Display Cabinet”; see Table 6): experts
perform more movement patterns than novices. Further differences can be identified: although
“Alternating Gazes” are top movement patterns for experts and novices, experts perform a lot
more “Alternating Gazes”. Similarly, experts perform “Long Gazes” much more often. Hence
117

experts are much more involved in appropriating exhibits and knowledge. This more intense
involvement with the exhibits needs more “Minor Orientation Gazes” in advance for selection
of exhibits. Accordingly, experts also perform more “Minor Orientation Gazes” than novices.
Another important result is that experts seem not only following the stick out affordance of a
display cabinet: “Window Shopping”. In contrast, they also wander along the display cabinet
without looking at it and thus follow affordances that are more silent. Despite these
differences, the movement behaviour of experts and novices is similar.

4.3. Cued Retrospective Reporting
The main difference between expert and novice visitors is the previous knowledge of the
experts. This reflects the selection of the visitors. For detailed results of the CRR, see
Appendices 10.3. Here a summary of the quantity of reporting shall suffice to demonstrate the
difference between expert and novice visitors.

88 (N = 3)

Table 7: Total numbers of CRR at each section of the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in
the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart

Despite the irregular sample sizes across the four sections it is evident (see Table 7) that
firstly, in total numbers experts verbalize more than novices in general and especially at the
display cabinets and secondly, experts and novices both together verbalize the most at section
4 (“The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”). This is in line with the frequency rates of the
movement patterns. Hence, in sum, experts are more actively appropriating and processing the
displayed issues and exhibits than the novices.

118

4.4. Individual Movement Patterns and Cognitive Processes: A Comparison between
One Expert and One Novice at Each Section
According to the previous results, there are differences between the sections:
-

more movement patterns at display cabinets vs. less movement patterns at freestanding
exhibits and

-

more movement patterns at “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet” vs. less movement
patterns at “The Homogeneous Display Cabinet”.

Moreover, there are differences between the visitor groups: experts perform more movement
patterns than novices.
Therefore, the prototypical examples in this paragraph were selected due to the following
criteria:
-

Differences between sections (freestanding versus display cabinet, homogeneous
display cabinet versus heterogeneous display cabinet)

-

Differences between visitors (single expert versus single novice)

-

Typical contrasting examples

-

Demonstrate several movement patterns

Hence, I selected one expert (E1) and one novice (N1) as representatives because the
behaviours of E1 and N1 stand in contrast, they perform several movement patterns and I can
compare their viewing behaviours according to the differences between the sections.
Remember that E1 is a male expert of social anthropology who is 25 years old and visited the
Linden-Museum once. E1 is very interested in the South Sea and completely interested in
anthropological museums. N1 is a male mechanical engineer who is 36 years old and visited
the Linden-Museum three times. He is interested in the South Sea and in anthropological
museums. Now, I provide some examples of movement patterns and CRR combined for these
selected museums visitors. According to a detailed description, I will provide the viewing
behaviours recorded by the MET with still images out of the MET video data and the
cognitive processes described in the CRR with the respective transcripts. Hence, the reader is
able to get an impression of the particular movement patterns and the respective cognitive
processes that go along with it in the course of viewing each section.

Conclusion:
-

-

Confusion with similar looking houses.
Hence, the design suggestion is to avoid
placing similar looking objects close to
each other, especially not, if they
demonstrate different issues.
Details in the house painting invite
“Long Gaze” (see Figure 33).
“Wandering Along” (see Figure 34) is
enough to get the gist of the display: the
rooster.
“Minor Orientation Gaze” (see Figure
35) is performed to get an overview of
the display.
The expert spent more time than the
novice.

-

-

“Insights” (see Figure 36) are likely
performed when visitors walk along
the open roof of the men’s house
model.
This visitor is an engineer. This is
probably the reason for his interest in
technical issues like the indentation in
the floor.

Conclusion:

-

Design suggestion: Exhibits not only
can be protected by displaying them in
display cabinets but also by using
markers like tiny flat platforms (see
Figure 37 – 39).
“Object Scans” (see Figure 38 and 39)
are likely performed at big exhibits to
get the gist of its size. Size matters for
this novice. Like he was interested in
the indentation in the floor of “The
Men’s House Model from Palau”, this
engineer is interested in technical issues
again.

Here, “Alternating Gazes” (see Figures

similar looking exhibits. Again the

looking objects close to each other,
visitors likely get confused.

well as combs as well as jewellery are
displayed. And in this part I realized that
at least these display cabinets are
arranged according to islands. Whereas
Palau, I think, was presented twice or was
interrupted”.
131

Conclusion:
-

-

-

The expert was focused on the overall
structure of the exhibition and one
particular theme: the feathers,
especially the feathers on the comb.
The expert criticized the presentation.
The combs close to the text panels had
no feathers as it was described in the
text (see Figure 47). In fact, his
memory about the text panel was
wrong. Nevertheless again the design
suggestion: better put items that belong
together close to each other.
Additionally, if you want your visitors
to read text panels put them as close to
the belonging exhibits as possible.
The expert spent much more time and
performed a lot more and a broader
range of different movement patterns
(see Figure 47-55) at the
heterogeneous display cabinet than the
novice.

-

The novice is not interested viewing
this heterogeneous display cabinet with
the broad range of exhibits. “Window
Shopping” (see Figure 56) is enough to
shortly evaluate the exhibits as not
interesting for this visitor.

In sum: The expert spent more time, performed more and a broader range of different
movement patterns and reported more than the novice, especially at the display cabinets.
Hence, the novice is not as much appropriating the sections as the expert. The novice’s
appropriation of the exhibition is rather simpler or more reduced. The novice is especially
interested in the freestanding exhibits with technical aspects. He only seems to be interested in
constructional engineering. Probably because he is a mechanical engineer, he is rather
interested in exhibits that demonstrate the skilful constructions of Micronesian boat and house
building. The expert also acknowledges fine grained handicrafts.
At this point, I can only provide these exemplary examples. The observation study presented
in the next chapter also provides general conclusions about visitor behaviour.

4.5. Conclusion
In conclusion, I want to stress firstly, that 18 distinct, recurrent and systematic movement
patterns from the visitors’ own perspective were identified that are performed to appropriate
the temporary “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition on the
132

micro-level. This native’s point of viewing exhibitions is characterized by a great variability
of movement patterns that can be categorized into four types: movement patterns concerned
with (i) orientation, (ii) strolling, (iii) exhibits and (iv) human beings. Thereby the previous
findings by Treinen (1988) “cultural window shopping”, Aleida Assmann (1995) “long gaze”
and Mayr et al (2009) first insights in alternating and orientating gazes (see Chapter 2) were
successfully proven. Thus applying MET in visitor studies and socio-cultural anthropology
provided very new insights into the viewing behaviours of museum visitors. So many distinct
movement patterns have not yet been reported in such large numbers and diversity by
conventional methods like observation.
This proves that visitors actively appropriate exhibitions by performing a broad range of
different movement patterns. These movement patterns shape the museum experience largely
with performing increasingly different movement patterns leading to a more elaborate
processing and hence deeper experience of the exhibition. By applying MET, the focus is
clearly on the visual sense, the bodily and learning experience (for a critical reflection about
applying MET read Chapter 7).
Secondly, these patterns are performed according to the affordance of an exhibit or the design
of an exhibition section. There are differences between freestanding exhibits versus display
cabinets, and homogeneous versus heterogeneous display cabinets. Thereby “The
Heterogeneous Display Cabinet” leads to appropriation that is more active. Some affordances
are more likely to be perceived and hence lead to more particular movement patterns than
others. Hence, there are primary, secondary, tertiary and none movement patterns frequencies.
There is a clear ranking in perceiving affordances. This is in line with Norman’s (2013)
finding that signifiers are needed sometimes in design for pointing towards important issues
and exhibits when affordances are less likely to be perceived (see also Chapter 6). Thus the
concept of affordance by Gibson (1979) is a useful concept to study the movement patterns of
museum visitors and should be complemented with Norman’s (2013) idea of signifiers in the
design suggestions later on.
Thirdly, the analysis of cognitive processes expressed in the CRR shows similar results
regarding the displayed exhibits and information than the movement patterns analysis.
Furthermore the exemplary comparison between the CRR and movement patterns of one
expert and one novice shows that their professions influences their agenda and hence their
viewing behaviours and cognitive processes. This echoes the selection criteria of how the
133

experts and novices were selected. The only differentiation that was made was the
professions. No further data about the kind of expertise or non-expertise was collected. Due to
the small sample, only cautious conclusions can be made about the differences and
similarities between experts and novices. This is a clear limitation of the study. Nevertheless,
expert visitors are more active, perform a broader range of different movement patterns and
react to more silent affordances compared to novice visitors.
Hence, it is likely a combination of design factors/exhibit characteristics and personal
characteristics of visitors are determining or affording particular movement patterns, although
I focused on frequencies across all visitors and not on frequencies on each single visitor.
Thus, I follow largely the interaction approach represented by Bitgood (2006) and Rounds
(2004), although I criticise this approach partially for its simple formula (benefits divided by
costs as the value of the exhibition visit) in general and the “saving steps” principle by
Bitgood (2006) in particular. Of course, this can explain visitors’ viewing behaviours largely,
but it cannot explain every phenomenon. There are exceptions that do not fit in the formula
like “Turns” for example. “Turns” are frequently performed movement patterns of strolling
that do not save steps. Nevertheless Bitgood is right that visitors save steps most of their visit.
Visitors do not backtrack very often. They do not even look back very often. Think of the few
“Backward Gazes” that were performed. Rounds (2004: 401) is right with his search rules that
serve as “initial scanning mechanism”. That is how movement patterns of strolling like
“Turns”, “Window Shopping” and “Wandering Along” work. Therefore, the movement
patterns of strolling also serve for orientation like the “Minor Orientation Gaze” does. Indeed,
orientation and strolling for orientation plays a crucial role for selecting exhibits or for
performing more elaborate movement patterns that deal with the exhibits themselves.
Finally, yet importantly, the following preliminary suggestions for designing exhibitions can
be summarized in detail so far. Note that each way of presenting exhibits has its trade-offs.
Thus, these design suggestions are meant as suggestions and not absolute advice. These
design suggestions are primarily made in the context of the possible eye movement patterns,
which are probably evoked by the affordances of the exhibition design.

134

(i) Window Shopping/Wandering Along
If you do not want your visitors snoozing actively in your exhibition, hence, if you do not
want them “Window Shopping” although you want to use display cabinets, make the
display cabinets as short as possible. Be aware that you are not safe from active snoozing,
just because you do not put the exhibits in display cabinets but present them freestanding.
“Wandering Along” at freestanding exhibits is a similar phenomenon as “Window
Shopping” at display cabinets. Short and changing inputs seem to be the solution that
works against active snoozing.

(ii) Insight:
If you want your visitors to look inside an exhibit, the best you could do is present it
freestanding with an opening.

(iii) Changing Perspective:
If you want your visitors to look at the exhibit from different perspectives, present it
hanging, regardless of whether you put it in a display cabinet or not. As mentioned above
this movement pattern proves one of the most important and distinguishing features
encountered in exhibitions: the ability to go off and to explore in multiple possible ways
and from a number of perspectives. This ability makes museums unique experiences and
arguably, it is the main attraction of museums compared to other mass media like TV and
computers for example.

(iv) Alternating Gaze:
If you want your visitors to compare exhibits with each other or exhibits with information,
put these items close together.

In general:
(i) Orientation even in smaller sections of an exhibition plays a crucial role in visiting
exhibitions. Hence, the overall structure of your exhibition should be kept as clear as
possible applying a clear designed display. Seemingly, obvious signs or signifiers (cf.
135

Norman 2013, see Chapter 2) are highly welcomed. However, be aware that backtracking
and “Backward Gazes” are rarely performed to get the gist of an exhibition. Hence,
notably visible initial information about the exhibition theme and structure could be
provided right at the entrance.

(ii) To avoid confusion, place items apart from each other that do not belong to each other.

(iii) Likewise, place items together that belong together.

(iv) Heterogeneous presentation leads to more active visitor behaviour and cognitive
processing. It puts the exhibits in the centre of visitors’ attention, which increases the
likelihood of even longer attention and hence “Long Gazes”.

(v) We can provide the first evidence for one reason behind “museum fatigue” (Davey 2005
see Chapter 2): homogenous presentation.

(vi) In the end, display cabinets work well. Display cabinets work even better compared to
freestanding exhibits, and better still if the display cabinets hold a heterogeneous range of
exhibits. Display cabinets maybe are more effective than freestanding exhibits because
putting exhibits behind glass creates an aura of value (Thiemeyer submitted). However,
when the roles of affordances are considered, another explanation seems plausible. One
might think that display cabinets limit the affordances or even prevent interaction, as can
be concluded by Norman’s definition of glass walls as constituting an “anti-affordance”
(2013: 11); see Chapter 2). Norman is right insofar that visitors do not walk through
display cabinets, thus display cabinets probably provide security not only for the exhibits
but also for the visitors. Visitors may feel more comfortable with well-known display
cabinets and their affordance of limitation by glass walls and thus perform more and a
broader range of possible movement patterns than at freestanding exhibits. More research
about the possible role of security must be conducted.

136

These design suggestions may seem familiar to exhibition makers, but until now a
comprehensive system of design suggestions related to particular movement patterns and
based on the theory of affordances was missing. This chapter marks a first step towards such a
comprehensive system.
As it was demonstrated, the movement patterns are related to head, trunk and body
movements largely and connected with cognitive processes. Thus, movement patterns of
visitors in exhibitions demonstrate a clear case of embodiment. Whether these movement
patterns are culturally learned and hence are cross-culturally different must be examined by
further visitor studies. As a next step in this thesis, the movement patterns of these observable
head, trunk and body movements will be confirmed by systematic observation. Furthermore,
the observation study investigates the influence of the audio guide that was not investigated in
this MET study. Due to the sensitive calibration of the MET device that is mounted on the
visitors’ head the audio guide, usage was excluded in to avoid slip outs of the MET position.
However, audio guide usage does not interfere with external observation as will be described
in the next chapter.

Observed Movement Patterns and Cued Retrospective Reporting: The Results of the
Second Visitor Study at the Linden-Museum

This chapter reports the results of the systematic observation study conducted in the “South
Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in
Stuttgart in 2010. The systematic observation study had several aims.
The first aim was to determine whether the 15 movement patterns identified in the first phase
of MET data analysis presented in previous Chapter 4 could also be detected and validated
using systematic observation. Thus, firstly, we must ask whether observation also validate the
micro-level of movement patterns. Phrased differently, can the visitor’s point of viewing
exhibitions also be validated by an external observer? I will demonstrate that external
observation can validate the visitor’s point of view largely but not completely. MET is more
precise than external observation.
The second aim was to determine the frequencies of the 15 movement patterns identified by
the observation study and to compare the results of both studies with each other. Are there
differences in the frequency rates of the movement patterns between MET and systematic
observation, and if so why? I will show that the differences rely on the different applied
methods with MET being more exact.
The third aim was to examine the influence of audio guide usage on the movement patterns
and their accompanying cognitive processes expressed in the CRR. Presumably, audio guide
usage must influence the visitors’ movement behaviours by allowing visitors to view and
listen at the same time. Remember that the audio guide provided additional information about
the issues and exhibits of the exhibition (for a detailed description of the audio guide in this
exhibition read Chapter 3, paragraph 3.1.1).
Does audio guide usage prolong the dwell time in exhibitions as previous research by Kuflik
et al. 2011 and Lanir et al. 2013 (see Chapter 1) found? Yes, it does (for more information
read paragraph 5.3.2.). In what way does this digital guide influence the movement patterns
and the accompanying cognitive processes? Are Franklin et al. (1993) correct that further
information leads to a different cognitive processing but not to a different guidance in viewing
behaviour? No, they are wrong. Audio guide usage leads to directed viewing and a deeper
cognitive processing due to the change of attention for particular affordances.

138

Are there differences in appropriating exhibitions between audio guide usage and non-usage?
Are Smith & Tinio (2008) and Bitgood (2010) right that audio guide usage allows a parallel
way of appropriation: viewing and listening at the same time? Or are the prejudices right that
audio guide usage leads to more listening than viewing or even to zombie-like behaviour
(Tallon 2006; see Chapter 1)? Remember that Tallon (2006) stresses the need to investigate
whether audio guides allow behaviour that is more active. I will provide evidence that audio
guide usage leads to a longer dwell time, more active movement behaviours and a deeper
cognitive processing. Furthermore, I will provide evidence for parallel appropriation, which is
an incorporation of the visual with the auditive sense. Audio guides are incorporated into the
embodiment and therefore audio guide usage leads to an extended museum experience by
incorporating the auditive sense in the appropriation of exhibitions. In the end, I provide
further design suggestions for implementing audio guides in exhibitions.
This chapter is structured in five paragraphs: firstly, an introduction into the systematic
observation study; secondly, a comparison of the MET study and the systematic observation
study results; thirdly, an analysis of the audio guide’s influence on the observed movement
patterns; fourthly, examples of cognitive processes represented in the CRR of visitors who do
not use the audio guide and visitors who use it at the four selected sections within the “South
Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition; and lastly, a summarizing
conclusion including specific design suggestions.

5.1 The Systematic Observation Study
Before presenting the results, I will first describe the research process: the preparation, the
observer’s point of view at the four selected exhibition sections, the full sample of the
participating visitors, the procedure and the analysis.

5.1.1 Preparation
The field study was conducted at the four selected sections in the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition described above in Chapter 3. This observation
study was systematically conceptualised based on the results of the first MET data analysis
that identified 15 distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns.
139

5.1.2 The Observer’s Point of View at the Four Selected Exhibition Sections
Therefore, once again I provide photographs of these sections but this time from the
observer’s point of view. Hence, the reader can reconstruct the observation conditions or
perspectives. The observer observed which of the 15 movement patterns identified in the first
phase of MET data analysis and how often the visitors performed them at each section. Thus,
the occurrences as well as the frequencies of the movement patterns were observed.

In sum, these photographs (Figure 57-62) reveal that the observer’s point of view is more
restricted due to observing the visitor from one fixed position unlike the scene cameras of the
MET that record the participant’s perspective. Furthermore, other exhibits and human beings
can obstruct the view of the external observer. Hence, details are more difficult to observe by
external observation (for a detailed comparison of the potentials and limitations of MET and
observation please look at Chapter 7).

5.1.3 Full Sample of Participating Visitors (N = 80)
Twenty visitors were observed at each of the four sections. In sum, 80 randomly selected
visitors (37 female) were followed by an unobtrusive observer. Unlike the MET study, the
group of visitors at each section were not the same.
The age was estimated into three groups: young (18-29), middle (30-59) and older (60+).
Twenty visitors were young, 27 were middle aged and 33 were older.
Forty-three visited the exhibition alone, 30 in a pair of two and 7 in a group of maximum 5.
This does not demonstrate the natural way of visiting the exhibition because only these kinds
of appearance (alone, in a pair of two and in a group of maximum 5) in the exhibition were
selected for an observation. Bigger groups are just more difficult to observe.
143

Dwell Time:
Range between under 0.5 minutes and ten minutes.

Usage of Audio Guide:
The observer watched ten visitors who used the audio guide and ten visitors who did not use
the audio guide at the four sections. Hence, the audio guide usage varied by the observer and
therefore does not demonstrate the natural frequency of usage. Sometimes more museum
visitors took away an audio guide but did not use it at the observed section; note that only use
of the audio guide varied in this study. The audio guide could be used more than one time at
the sections because there can be more than one audio station or because the visitor already
listened to another audio station as she enters the section, as is reflect in Table 8:

in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart

5.1.4 Procedure
The observation study was conducted unobtrusively at each section. The observed visitors
were not explicitly told that they were personally being watched during their stay in the
“South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition. However, an
information panel and information sheets were placed before the entrance of the exhibition
informing visitors in general that an observational study was taking place. Visitors who were
unwilling to participate in the study could put a clearly visible button on their clothes. This is

2

Although there is probably a correlation, I did not analyse the correlation between the length of an audio guide

spot and the dwell time.

144

a standard procedure used in observational studies and was approved by the local ethics
committee of the Leibniz Knowledge Media Research Centre in Tuebingen, Germany.
The study was conducted at each opening day and across the opening day of the museum. The
visitors were selected on a random basis, and every second museum visitor was observed.
Each fifth observed museum visitor was also interviewed. Hence, 10 visitors that used the
audio guide and 10 visitors that did not use the audio guide were observed at each section, and
two visitors from each group were interviewed. After selecting a visitor, a trained observer
documented all the actions performed by the visitor in a notation scheme (see Appendices
10.4.) including the estimated age of the observed visitors and the social context of their visit
(alone, in a dyad, or as a member of a larger group of three to five).

5.1.5

Analysis

The data was analysed in two ways: first, analyses assessed the comparability between the
observation study and the MET study; and second, analyses evaluated the influence of audio
guide usage on the observed movement patterns and cognitive processes.

5.2. Comparison with the Mobile Eye Tracking Study Results
The sample from the MET study was compared with the sample from the observation study
that did not use an audio guide for reasons of comparability. The MET study visitors did not
use an audio guide due to sensitive calibration of the MET device that was mounted on the
visitors’ head, and hence providing accurate recordings.

Note that in the observation study different groups of visitors were investigated at each time:
Ten visitors at each of the four sections; in sum 40 visitors were observed, whereas in the
MET study the same group of six to eight visitors at each section was investigated, in order to
compare the results and draw conclusions about the applied methods: observation versus
MET (see Table 9).

5.2.1. Total Numbers
Table 9 shows the total numbers of movement patterns at each section. Firstly, precisely due
to the different sample sizes between those studies, there is a clear tendency that more
movement patterns are detected by MET data analysis than with traditional observation.
Hence, with MET more movement patterns can be identified. For a further critical reflection
of the applied methods, read description below and in Chapter 7.
Secondly, the same order of frequency rates occurs in each section: the most movement
patterns are identified at section 4 (“The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”), followed by
section 3 (“The Homogenous Display Cabinet”), followed by section 2 (“The Original
Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap”), followed by section 1 (“The Men’s House Model from
Palau”). Hence, it seems that the results of the MET study and the results of the systematic
observation study are comparable, although the sample sizes differ a bit. Again, “The
Heterogeneous Display Cabinet” leads to the most active viewing behaviour.

5.2.2.

Individual Movement Patterns

First, except for “Major Orientation Gazes” all other movement patterns could be also
identified by systematic observation. This provides further evidence of the movement patterns
with a completely different method. Nevertheless, the individual results are more different
than similar (see Table 9). Where do these different results come from? I will provide
evidence that they are caused by a methodological problem.
Below I describe the results of Table 9 according to the movement patterns categories,
focusing on the observation study and the comparison between the observation study and the
MET study.

147

Movement Patterns and Orientation*
Altogether, “Minor Orientation Gazes” are the most frequent movement patterns in the
observation study. This is a similar result compared with the MET study. Orientation in a
closer part of the environment appears to be an important issue for museum visitors as they
navigate through exhibitions and select exhibits for a more detailed appropriation.
In contrast, “Major Orientation Gazes” are never identified in the systematic observation
study, at least in the non-audio-guide-usage condition. This pattern is performed when
entering a gallery/room.
“Backward Gazes” are also identified less often than in the MET study. External observers
seem to be more focused on obvious affordances and movement patterns.

Movement Patterns and Strolling**
“Window Shopping” and “Wandering Along” are identified according to the particular
sections (freestanding versus display cabinet), whereas “Window Shopping” is more often
identified by MET because with MET also shorter sequences of “Window Shopping” could
be identified.
“Turns” are not identified as often as in the observation study as in the MET study because
the rewind option of MET video data analysis helps to get results that are more accurate.

Movement Patterns and Exhibits***
“Reading Text Panels” is also performed especially often at display cabinets like in the MET
study. Nevertheless, it is less often identified here than in the MET study because exclusive
eye movements that do not need head or trunk movements cannot be identified by an external
observer. Another reason might be the obtrusive measurement by MET that leads to socially
desired behaviours.
“Reading Labels” is identified less often in the observation study than in the MET study.
“Reading Labels” is often identified in the MET study because the resolution level is higher
and it leads to socially desired behaviours.
“Long Gaze” is only performed more often at section 4 (“The Heterogeneous Display
Cabinet”) and the photo show at section 2 (“The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from
148

Yap”). Hence it provides further evidence that “Long Gazes” may occur more often with a
heterogeneous presentation or because a screen is attracting visitors’ attention. Nevertheless
they are less often identified here than in the MET study because exclusive eye movements
that do not need head or trunk movements cannot be identified by an external observer.
“Insights” are solely performed at the freestanding exhibits like in the MET study because
display cabinets prevent “Insights” or at least make them less likely.
“Changing Perspective” is identified less often than in the MET study. It is not identified at all
at section 3 (“The Homogenous Display Cabinet”) where the exhibits are presented hanging,
which was reasoned as affording “Changing Perspective”. Perhaps this finding can be
attributed to the small sample sizes in both studies not being sufficiently representative.
“Object Scans” are especially identified at big exhibits like the canoe (section 2: “The
Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap”) with its great dimensions, only one time at the
smaller men’s house model (section 1: “The Men’s House Model from Palau”) and not at all
at the display cabinets. Note that “Object Scans” that are “small” are conducted solely with
the eyes cannot be observed by an external observer.
“Alternating Gazes” are the second most often performed movement patterns in the
observation study. It is especially identified at section three and four (the two display
cabinets) like in the MET study. From this finding, it is evident that “Alternating Gazes” are
especially likely at display cabinets where many exhibits and labels are displayed in short
distances.
“Zooming Closer” is performed zero times at freestanding exhibits. This movement patterns
can be better observed by an external observer at display cabinets because display cabinets
provide a front line as a point of reference due to the pane of glass in the front. Additionally,
as mentioned above, MET provides a higher resolution level.

Movement Patterns and Human Beings****
“Social Gazes” are performed less often than in the MET study or even not at all. One reason
might be that only a few other museum visitors were around. Another reason might be the
perception of other human beings occurred through other senses like the hearing. A third
reason might be that a museum visit is about “things” rather than being about the

other

149

people. In contrast socially desired behaviours and the limits of a single lens camera can be
neglected as influential factors in the observation study.

In conclusion, I must point out firstly, that the sample sizes are different, which makes the
samples difficult to compare. Apart from that, MET appears to provide a higher resolution
level as an observation method and hence more identified movement patterns. MET also
provides the direct eye movements from the visitor’s perspective whereas observation can
only deduce eye movement by proxy movements of the head, the trunk and the whole body.
Furthermore, “Other movement patterns” are rarely identified by observation. Concentrating
on 15 different movement patterns at the same time is already difficult enough for the brain,
although the observation sheet was formatted due to possible chunking of movement patterns.
Being open for further new movement patterns is overloading the observer’s brain. Likewise
as an external observer who was trained to observe particular movement patterns, you are
likely to be aware of obvious affordances and movement patterns. For example, no
“Wandering Along” at display cabinets was observed.
Another difference is grounded in the different level of obtrusiveness between the two
methods: whereas MET is an obtrusive measurement that leads to socially desired behaviours
and hence to distortions in behaviour, the observation study was conducted as unobtrusively
as possible. Furthermore with MET you have a rewind option for as many analyses you want.
With observation that is conducted without video recording, the data only reflects the definite
moment and the current awareness of the observer. Apart from that, the paper-and-pencil
method applied for systematic observation slowed down the observation and distracts the
observer’s attention. This makes it highly doubtful that so many distinct movement patterns
could ever be identified by traditional observation alone. To put it the other way, so many
distinct movement patterns could only be identified through the application of MET. For a
further critical reflection of all applied methods read Chapter 7.

5.3. The Influence of Audio-Guide Usage on the Observed Movement Patterns
This time I focus on the influence of audio guide usage onto the observed movement patterns.
It is assumed that audio guide usage leads to different movement behaviours as it allows

150

viewing and listening at the same time. Therefore, the two groups (one group that used an
audio guide versus one group that did not use an audio guide) were compared.

5.3.1. Total Numbers of Movement Patterns across All Four Sections in Both

patterns
Table 10: Total numbers of movement patterns across all four sections of the “South Sea
Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition in both conditions

In general it seems that the usage of the audio guide leads to more movement patterns in sum
(see Table 10): The total numbers of movement patterns between the two conditions “Usage
of Audio Guide” and “Non-Usage of Audio Guide” show clearly that the audio guide usage
leads to twice as many movement patterns as without audio guide usage. Hence, it seems as
though audio guide usage leads to more active visitor behaviours evoking more involvement
with viewing exhibits and not less as it could be presumed by the summarization of Tallon &
Walker (2008). Thus, the prejudice about audio guides leading to zombie-like behaviour is a
fallacy.

5.3.2. Comparison between Audio Guide Usage and Non-Usage for Each Section and
Movement Pattern
Audio guide usage changes the chronological order of total numbers for each section. With
audio guide usage, more movement patterns are still performed at section 4 (“The
Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”), but this is followed by section 2 (“The Original Outrigger
Fishing Canoe from Yap”), followed by section 1 (“The Men’s House Model from Palau”)
and the least movement patterns are performed at section 3 (“The Homogenous Display
Cabinet”). Hence, the usage of an audio guide evokes the most passive behaviour at “The
151

Homogenous Display Cabinet” and the most active behaviour at “The Heterogeneous Display
Cabinet” and the freestanding exhibits.
The results of the average dwell time (see Table 11) correspond with the results of movement
patterns frequencies at each section. The more movement patterns one performs, the more
time is needed for performing these movement patterns, which provides further evidence that
time spent is in line with a more elaborate processing (see Chapter 1: Robinson 1928;
Boisvert & Slez, 1995; Serrell, 1998). This finding is also in line with findings from previous
studies (Kuflik et al., 2011; Lanir et al., 2013), which report that audio guide usage results in
prolonged examination time because it offers additional information about the exhibits.
As there are more movement patterns, hence behaviour that is more active and more time
spent. If visitors used an audio guide, then we have to carefully consider the content of the
audio guide spots at each section for a critical reflection about the differences in behaviours
between audio guide usage and non-usage. Note that the audio guide spots only provide pure
information narrated by a female or a male voice without any music or further sounds (see
Appendices 10.1.1.). The conclusions about the correlation between audio guide usage and
viewing behaviours are preliminary so far. They have to be carefully confirmed through
further visitor research. The following Table 11 compares frequencies of movement patterns
between audio guide users and non-users. The biggest differences are highlighted.

Section 1: The Men’s House Model from Palau

At section 1 – “The Men’s House Model from Palau” – there are two audio guide spots (see
Chapter 3): number 806 (“Palau House”) and 807 (“Second House and Splayed Figure”).
The audio guide spot 806 provides references about the carved and painted beams of the
gables, painted facades, high roofs, the corner posts, the Mortise and Tenon joints and the
outrigger canoe motif, the rooster motif and the story about taro roots and rays as well as a
reference to the sacred house. The audio guide spot 807 describes the gable figure “dilukai”,
provides various interpretations about its spread legs and informs about its location on the
chieftains’ or men’s houses.
The results (see Table 11) can be explained with the references in the audio guide text:
-

“Wandering Along” (12 without AG:30 with AG) is performed the most due to the
rooster motif that is painted all along the house.

-

More “Minor Orientation Gazes” (12:23), “Turns” (1:9) and “Changing Perspective”
(0:8) are performed due to the multiple references about the architectural structure and
the components of the house. Visitors need to get an overview, turn in the mentioned
direction and get a change of perspective at different points of “The Men’s House Model
from Palau”.

-

More “Insights” (4:17) are performed because the audio guide text provides references,
for example about the Mortise and Tenon joints and carved and painted beams that are
visible inside “The Men’s House Model from Palau”.

-

More “Long Gazes” (2:7) are performed because the paintings and the rooster motif
invite an intense and long view.

-

More “Reading Labels” (1:5) as well as the “Other Movement Patterns” are performed
also because the visitors gain more freedom in movement because they get the desired
information about the exhibit anyway, no matter where they move and what they view.

Hence, this could be called a parallel way of appropriating exhibitions by listening and
viewing at the same time. This is in line with Smith & Tinio (2008) and Bitgood (2010).

Section 2: The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap

At section 2 – “The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap” – there is one audio guide
spot (see Chapter 3): 821 (“The Linden-Museum’s Outrigger Canoe”).
154

This audio guide spot provides information about the history, the usage and the mode of
operation as well as the re-construction of the outrigger fishing canoe in the “South Sea
Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition. Furthermore, it provides
references to several components such as the outrigger, the bow, the stern, the sennit rope, the
sail, the mast and the boat hulls. It also points to the impact of such outrigger canoes on
modern catamarans and trimarans.
The results (see Table 11) can largely be explained with the references in the audio guide text:
-

Accordingly, the visitor “Turns” (9:22) to the corresponding directions wanders along
and around the canoe (“Wandering Along” 8:16) and changes the perspective (“Changing
Perspective” 2:7).

-

The visitor scans the large exhibit according to the mentioned components (“Object
Scan” 6:14).

-

The visitor looks inside the canoe to view the construction connected with ropes
(“Insight” 2:13).

-

Additionally the visitor views photo presentation with “Long Gazes” (1:6) and compares
the photos with the canoe (“Alternating Gaze” 1:5).

-

Surprisingly “Minor Orientation Gazes” have similar frequencies in both conditions.

•

Section 3: The Homogenous Display Cabinet

At section 3 – “The Homogenous Display Cabinet” – there is one audio guide spot (see
Chapter 3): 811 (“Fiber Weaving”):
The audio guide spot 811 provides references to the various weavings (woven cloths, apronlike, warp-around skirts, patterned cloth, draw-string apron, mats), their origin from Asia and
the influence of the missionaries. It also refers to several components of this handicraft: the
loom and the natural fibres (banana and hibiscus). The position of the respective weavings is
mentioned rarely and only vaguely. Accordingly, the visitors certainly feel confused the same
as identified in the MET: the different weavings remain indistinguishable. More precise
information about the position of the particular weavings may have helped distinguish
between the single exhibits. Probably that is why there are fewer big differences between the
movement patterns frequencies of audio guide users and non-users except “Minor Orientation
Gazes” (10:23) and “Turns“” (7:12) which are performed to follow the audio guide spot’s

155

content. This might also explain that audio guide usage evokes the most passive behaviour at
the homogenous display cabinet.
•

Section 4: The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet

At section 4 – “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet” – there are two audio guide spots (see
Chapter 3): 808 (“Money, Barter, Valuables, Food Transport”) and 809 (“Chuuk, Curcuma”):
Audio guide spot 808 provides references to the special kind of money on Palau and its
current use in traditional life. It also refers to bracelets, the painting of the “money bird” on
men’s houses and the relation of traditional money – that reveals the person’s status as well as
food offers do – to the taro benches, molasses and vessels in the middle of the gallery behind
the display cabinet.
Audio guide spot 809 provides references to curcuma paste and its various functions and
usage, ponchos with spondylus discs, the feather combs and breadfruit (including a song text
about breadfruit). Obviously, the two audio guide spots choose only single exhibits out of the
diverse range of exhibits presented in the heterogeneous display cabinet.
-

Accordingly, fewer “Minor Orientation Gazes” (28:16) were performed. The audio
guide users concentrate on the described exhibits of the audio guide.

-

They compare these exhibits (“Alternating Gaze” 17:33) and follow the references that
also point to exhibits in the middle of the gallery backwards to the display cabinet
(“Turns” 2:10 and “Backward Gazes” 2:8).

-

Surprisingly, the audio guide users read even more text panels than the non-users
(“Reading Text Panels” 4:9) and they perform more “Window Shopping” (9:13). Both
findings might be explained by the action possibility of parallel viewing and listening.

In sum, audio guide usage leads to more movement patterns and hence to more active visitor
behaviour. However, audio guide usage does not increase gazes with minor affordances like
the “Major Orientation Gaze” that is performed at the entrance of a gallery. The main
difference in frequencies is between “The Homogenous Display Cabinet” with lesser
movement patterns rate change and the other sections (the freestanding exhibits and “The
Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”) with more rate change. Hence it seems that with audio
guide usage a homogenous presentation leads to less active behaviour. Instead,

other

156

presentation styles such as the freestanding and heterogeneous display cabinet lead to
behaviour that is more active.
The reasons for the changed behaviour under audio guide usage seem to be firstly, that due to
the information provided by the audio guide the visitor feels more freedom in behaviour as
she gets the information anyway no matter where she looks. Hence, audio guide usage allows
parallel ways of appropriating and experiencing exhibits and exhibitions: listening and
viewing at the same time. This is in line with Smith & Tinio (2008) and Bitgood (2010).
Secondly, the audio guide emphasized particular affordances of the exhibits/exhibition.
Hence, the audio guide text seems to direct the movement behaviour. This finding is not in
line with Franklin et al. (1993) who stressed that information like titles do not guide viewing
behaviour differently, but they did not focus on digital media. Nevertheless, both reasons
(freedom of movement and stressing of particular affordances) seem to be responsible for the
change in movement behaviour.
Especially, the following results are salient for audio guide users:
-

“Wandering Along” is increased at the freestanding exhibits and “Window Shopping”
at the heterogeneous display cabinet but not at the homogenous display cabinet. Audio
guide users perform “Social Gazes” more frequently. These three movement patterns
indicate the freedom of movement audio guide users likely feel.

-

“Turns” are the only movement patterns that are performed more frequently at ALL
sections. This indicates that the audio guide leads the movement behaviour. Visitors
turn to the mentioned direction.

-

“Long Gazes”, “Insights” and “Changing Perspective” are performed more often by
audio guide users at the freestanding exhibits. This indicates that the audio guide leads
the eye by providing precise references.

-

There are differences in behaviour between the sections (“The Homogenous Display
Cabinet” versus freestanding exhibits and “The Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”).

Hence, it seems, that the movement behaviour of audio guide users is similar at freestanding
exhibits and the movement behaviour is different at the display cabinets depending on the
presentation within them (homogenous versus heterogeneous). Thus, visitors’ behaviour
depends on the presentation design. Now let us have a look, if these results (more active
behaviour with audio guide usage, differences between homogenous presentation and other
ways of presentation) are also measurable in the cognitive processing of the sections.

5.4. Cued Retrospective Reporting – Interview Sample
At each section, two visitors who used an audio guide and two visitors who did not use an
audio guide were interviewed additionally after they had been observed. In sum, 16 visitors
were interviewed. The interview took place directly after observation and right at the section,
so the visitors still had the cue of the particular section and reported in retrospection, but this
time without viewing their eye movements. The interview guide is provided in the Appendices
10.5. Before describing the results of their reporting, I will describe the sample in the next
section.

5.4.1. Interview Sample (N = 16) out of the Full Sample (N = 80)
Eight visitors were female and eight were male. All interviewed visitors were asked about
their age and later grouped into the categories mentioned above: Three were young, one was
middle aged and 12 were older. Four visited the exhibition alone, eight in a pair of two and
four in a group of maximum five.

Dwell time:
Range between under 0.5 minutes up to 10 minutes

Profession:
All interviewed museum visitor were novices regarding their professions.

Motivation:
Seven of 16 interviewed visitors visited the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the
Western Pacific” exhibition due to their particular interest in this exhibition. Two of 16 visited
the exhibition due to their regular museum visiting. Four of 16 visited the exhibition due to
personal relations like it follows:

158

-

One female visitor, kindergarten teacher, 60+: worked for peace and against atomic tests
in Oceania, hosted people from Oceania for three weeks in cooperation with the LindenMuseum, was on Tahiti for holidays

-

One male visitor, soldier, 60+: son is development worker on Papua New Guinea
(Bougainville)

-

One male visitor, motor mechanic, 60+: was with his wife on holidays in New Zealand
and saw the art of boat building by Maoris there

-

One female visitor, real-estate assistant agent, 30-59: her brother worked on Kiribati

One visited the exhibition due to bad weather, one because she had free tickets and one made
no statement. All of the interviewed visitors were German speaking and first time visitors in
this exhibition like the visitors in the MET study.

Number of Visits in the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart:
Five visitors visited the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart for the first time, eight the second to
tenth time and three more than the eleventh time.

Interest in South Sea (scale: 1= not interested to 5 = completely interested):
One visitor made no statement, no visitors indicated they were not interested or a little
interested in the South Sea, respectively five were interested, very interested and completely
interested in the South Sea.

Interest in Ethnographic Museums (scale: 1= not interested to 5 = completely interested):
One visitor made no statement, no visitors indicated they were not interested or a little
interested in anthropological museums, respectively six were interested and completely
interested and three were very interested in anthropological museums.

The frequency rates at each section are different (see Table 12). One cannot conclude a clear
systematic order between audio guide usage and non-usage. This is probably related to the
smaller size of the interview sample and the reading of text panels in the non-audio usage
condition. Hence, it seems there are two methodological problems. Regarding the sample size,
there was not enough time for data collection due to the time limit of the special exhibition
“South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” and due to the short-staffed
situation of only one observer. Apart from that, the problem with text panel reading is
grounded in the consecutive research design that started explorative with MET and succeeded
in a systematic approach of observation. Since text panel reading was allowed in the MET
study, I did not extract it in the observation study for reasons of comparability.

5.4.3. Exemplary Examples of Cued Retrospective Reporting with and without Audio
Guide Usage
Nevertheless, in the exemplary examples that will follow below, I can demonstrate that the
audio guide seems to lead to a more elaborative processing of the subject matter.

difficult to connect with an audio guide.

In sum, if visitors just view the exhibition and do not gather information via text panel reading
or via audio guide listening, then they only draw general conclusions about the exhibition
based on the display. It seems as though text panel reading has a similar effect as audio guide
usage. This reflects the similar contents provided by the text panels and the audio guide.
However there are two big differences between text panel reading and audio guide listening.
Firstly, text panels were rarely read completely but audio guide spots were usually listened to
168

completely. Hence, with audio guide usage more information is gathered. Secondly, the
parallel appropriation or processing of viewing and receiving information about the viewed
exhibits at the same time provides an extended period of dwell time and a more elaborate
processing by movement patterns.
Apart from that, it seems that a homogeneous presentation does not lead to an elaborate
processing at all, even with audio guide usage. Maybe big headers within the display cabinet
that provide references about the different weavings would provide more helpful and precise
information about the exact exhibits’ position.

5.5. Conclusion
First, all 15 movement patterns identified in the first phase of MET data analysis were also
validated by systematic observation. A comparison of the total numbers across the sections in
both studies provides further evidence that the results are similar and hence comparable,
although the samples sizes differ a bit. Thus, the first 15 movement patterns are robust also in
method comparison. Again, the main result was that heterogeneous display cabinets lead to
the most active viewing behaviours.
Secondly, although the total numbers are similar, the individual numbers of movement
patterns in both studies are rather different. Additionally, more movement patterns are
identified in general by MET than by observation. MET provides more precise results than
observation. Hence, it seems that the difference between the individual movement patterns
results is grounded in the different methods. Thus, an external observer can also validate the
emic point of viewing exhibitions by visitors largely but not completely. Therefore, these two
methods will be compared in detail in Chapter 7.
Thirdly, audio guide usage leads to more movement patterns. With audio guide usage, visitors
have more capacity to appropriate exhibitions by particular movement patterns. This
difference between audio guide usage and non-usage seems to be grounded in the parallel
versus one-eyed way of appropriation and experience. Audio guide usage allows parallel
viewing and listening at the same time. Thus, the embodiment of the exhibition is broadened
by audio guide usage due to the merging of the visual and auditory sense while being in
bodily action. Likewise, the audio guide usage broadens the museum experience and leads to
a more elaborate learning and multisensory experience. Audio guide usage shapes the viewing
169

behaviour into more elaborate and complex viewing behaviours especially at freestanding
exhibits and the heterogeneous display cabinet. This validates Smith & Tinio's (2008) and
Bitgood's (2010) findings and demonstrates more empirical evidence in support of audio
guide usage. The prejudices about digital guide usage summarized by Tallon & Walker
(2008) are wrong, particularly that visitors are either more focused on listening than on
viewing while they use audio guides or they are behaving like zombies and thus are rather
passive while they use audio guides. This finding is also not in line with Franklin et al. (1993)
who reported that titles do not influence the viewing behaviour at exhibits. However, these
studies did not focus on digital media. In contrast, my research demonstrates that the
references of the audio guide texts highlight particular affordances in the exhibition and
accordingly guide the visitors’ attention and viewing behaviour. In sum, audio guide usage
changes the movement behaviour of visitors as it was presumed.
Regarding the cognitive processing of the audio guide spots by visitors, there is a clear
tendency that no additional information consumption (neither text panels nor audio guide
usage) leads only to a general processing of the display; in contrast audio guide usage and text
panel reading both lead to a more elaborate processing. Although text panel reading seems to
have a similar effect as audio guide usage, there is one main difference: the prolonged and
hence more elaborate consumption of the audio guide spots in contrast to a shorter
consumption of text panels. This is in line with previous research reported in Chapter 1 about
the prolonged dwell time of visitors using digital guides (Kuflik et al. 2011, Lanir, Kuflik,
Dim, Wecker & Stock 2013).
Further research about audio guide processing and text panel processing must be conducted.
On the one hand, research that varies systematically between the two conditions of text panel
reading and audio guide usage and on the other hand, research about the natural frequency of
audio guide usage and text panel reading.
Hence, my design suggestion for implementing audio guides in exhibitions is a careful
consideration: What is the use of text panels that provide the same or similar information as
an audio guide? What about dropping such text panels in favour of audio guides who lead to a
more active and hence more elaborate appropriation of an exhibition and even allow a parallel
appropriation of viewing and listening at the same time? Thus, what about using the audio
guide as the only source of information instead of using it as an additional source of

170

information? Of course such a design is difficult to implement due to reasons of accessibility
for every human being and because audio guide usage largely prevents social interaction.
However now, we will switch to the second MET study in an exhibition that uses a tablet-like
digital guide as the only source of further information in a literature exhibition. This tablet
guide also provides written text and therefore works different as an audio guide and hence it
can be used as the only source of information more likely. Whereas the handling of the audio
guide was easy and explained in the first audio guide spot (No. 800, see Chapter 3), the
tablet-like digital guide in this literature exhibition claims more elaborate technical skills.

6. Mobile Eye Tracking and Cued Retrospective Reporting – Part Two: Results of the
Visitor Study at the LiMo
This chapter will provide the results of the explorative mobile eye tracking (MET) study
combined with cued retrospective reporting (CRR) in the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo in
Marbach a.N. in 2010. Remember that 18 distinct, recurrent and systematic movement
patterns were identified in the first MET study in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in
the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart (see Chapter 4). Fifteen of
them were confirmed by systematic observation in the same exhibition (see Chapter 5). Can
these or even further movement patterns be identified by MET in the “nexus” exhibition at the
Museum of Modern Literature (LiMo) in Marbach a. N.? I will show that most movement
patterns can also be identified in the “nexus” exhibition, whereas only some are missing and
even further movement patterns are occurring (see Table 14). Thus, the results of this second
MET study will extend our knowledge about the emic point of viewing exhibitions. Hence,
this chapter works as an extension of the basic Chapter 4. Therefore, these chapters are
weighted unequally. This chapter focuses “only” on the occurrences of movement patterns
and does not provide their frequencies. In addition, it provides qualitative examples of
movement behaviour and accompanying cognitive processes.
“nexus” is an exhibition about a different issue, namely literature, in a different, modern
building with a completely different exhibition design, namely mainly homogenous display
cabinets structured in four rows of manuscripts, books, letters and relics. Remember that
although display cabinets in general lead to more movement patterns in sum than freestanding
exhibits, homogenous display cabinets provide less affordances and hence lead to less
complex viewing behaviour than heterogeneous display cabinets. How do visitors appropriate
an exhibition with almost homogenous display cabinets? I will provide evidence that the
homogeneous presentation in “nexus” leads to a different range of movement patterns.
Furthermore, the completely glassy display cabinets lead to further movement patterns. The
cognitive processing is largely influenced by the usage of the digital guide M3 (multimedia
museums guide) especially when used by the experts.
Thus, the aims of this MET study were: firstly, to verify all 18 movement patterns in a
different exhibition in order to determine whether they might be generalizable. Secondly, to
look for further movement patterns that can be found in this almost homogenous exhibition.
172

Thirdly, the aim was to examine again the difference between experts and novices regarding
their appropriation and experience of the “nexus” exhibition. Fourthly, the aim was to
examine the influence of the tablet-like medium, M3, on the appropriation of exhibits by
particular movement patterns and the respective cognitive processes as well as the consequent
experience of the “nexus” exhibition.
This chapter is structured in five paragraphs: firstly, an introduction into the MET study in the
“nexus” exhibition; secondly, an extended list of movement patterns that demonstrate that
these movement patterns are also valid in a completely different exhibition; thirdly, an
exemplary comparison of the viewing behaviour and cognitive processing by a single expert
and a single novice who do not use the M3; fourthly, an exemplary comparison of the viewing
behaviour and cognitive processing by a single expert and a single novice who use the M3,
and lastly, a summarizing conclusion including specific design suggestions.

6.1. The Field Study at the LiMo
Before describing the results, I will firstly describe the research process of the explorative
MET study in the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo: the preparation, the participating visitors,
the procedure and the analysis.

6.1.1. Preparation
The field study was conducted in the “nexus” exhibition described above in Chapter 3. Before
the study was conducted, I had to find visitors without corneal dysfunctions and I had to find
a MET that ensured a better video quality and could cope with the relative darkness of 50 Lux
in the “nexus” exhibition. Together with colleagues of the KMRC who also worked with
METs I assessed the Locarna PT Mini as the adequate device (designed 2010;
http://www.locarna.com/products.html). Additionally I had to learn how to use this MET
device.

173

6.1.2. Participating Visitors
The sample size was eight participating visitors: four “experts” (persons with prior knowledge
of the subject matter, e.g., students of German Studies and German Literature or Philology)
and four “novices” (persons with only cursory or even no prior knowledge of the subject
matter and with no knowledge about museology, museum education or exhibition design). No
further data about their expertise and non-expertise was collected. Table 13 summarizes the
basic information regarding the sample. All participants were German-speaking and visited
the LiMo and the “nexus” exhibition for the first time and had no prior knowledge about this
exhibition or how to navigate through it, like the visitors of the MET study at the LindenMuseum. Hence in sum, 16 visitors participated between the two MET studies described in
this thesis. As far as I know, these two MET studies had the largest sample size for examining

Sample of the MET Study in the "nexus" Exhibition at the LiMo in Marbach: Visitors’ Social Data:

6.1.3. Procedure
As mentioned above I applied the Locarna PT Mini for the MET study at the LiMo. Figure 67
shows the calibration of the Locarna PT Mini and Figure 68 shows the Locarna PT Mini in
the field: in the “nexus” exhibition.

Figure 67: Calibration of the Locarna PT Mini (photograph by Kira Eghbal-Azar)

Figure 68: The Locarna PT Mini designed and applied in the “nexus” exhibition in 2010
(photograph by Kira Eghbal-Azar with kind permission from the LiMo)
176

The procedure was conducted the same as at the LiMo like at the Linden-Museum for reasons
of comparability with two exceptions: I used a different MET (see Figure 67 and 68) and I
varied the digital medium usage (see Figure 68). Two expert visitors and two novice visitors
were equipped with the digital medium M3 for their exhibition visit and two expert visitors
and two novice visitors visited the exhibition without the digital medium.
The M3 was described in detail in Chapter 3. There are several previously discussed details
that are worth keeping in mind now: Each of the 1300 exhibits in the “nexus” exhibition was
only labelled by year and author name. For further information, visitors had to use this code to
log in to the M3 “nexus” menu. Hence the information level was completely divided from the
display level. The M3 worked as an integral impartation medium and not as an additional
subset as most digital guides are used in exhibitions. The M3 provided short information for
each of the 1300 exhibits in “nexus”, as well as a photograph and a transcription of each
exhibit. It also provides possibilities to connect with exhibits of the same year, the same
author or the same issue. Finally, it additionally provides several audio tours.
Due to the sensitive calibration of the MET that is mounted on the visitors’ head, I did not
provide earphones for the participating visitors in general. Similarly I did not provide the
audio guide in the MET study at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart. Without the earphones and
hence the audio guide function the M3 did not interfere with the MET and its calibration.
Hence it was possible to provide this digital guide in a reduced form in this MET study.
Again I applied the MET in an exploratory fashion, to help document and analyse the
movement patterns of visitors, i.e., what visitors “really” looked at as they moved freely
through the exhibition (for further information read procedure description of Chapter 4). All
participants received the following open and standardized instruction for their exhibition visit
after calibrating the MET: “Please view the exhibition naturally at your own speed, following
your own wishes and needs. There are no further specifications, even no time specification on
how to carry out this visit. Your knowledge acquisition about the exhibition will not be tested
afterwards”.
The visitor verbalised in retrospection with their own MET video as cue and again the
following standardized instruction was given: “Now I present you the video recorded by the
MET during your visit of the exhibition. While watching the video, please

describe

177

spontaneously what you viewed, perceived, thought and felt at various points and what you
paid attention to”.
The local ethics committee of the Leibniz Knowledge Media Research Centre in Tuebingen,
Germany approved this study.

6.1.4. Analysis
Like the MET study analysis at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart, before data analysis of the
eye movement recordings at the LiMo, the MET videos had to be synchronized with the
reporting retrospectively according to video cues. One video without audio and one with
audio were recorded for all participating visitors of the “nexus” exhibition.
According to the research aims, there were four phases of data analysis.

Phase one:
Phase one of data analysis examined the comparability of the two MET study results in both
exhibitions. Hence, I analysed whether I could identify the 18 movement patterns in the
“nexus” exhibition at the LiMo that were originally found in the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart. For reasons of
comparability I chose the four visitors that did not use the digital medium M3. I watched the
complete videos of these four visitors in natural speed with rewind option looking only for
occurrences and not for the frequencies of each movement patterns.

Phase two:
Phase two of data analysis searched for further movement patterns in the “nexus” exhibition
that were not identified yet. Hence, I watched the complete videos of all eight visitors in
natural speed with rewind option looking for new movement patterns.

178

Phase three:
Phase three examined the differences and similarities in movement patterns and cognitive
processes exemplarily between the different visitor groups (experts versus novices). Therefore
the prototypical examples were selected due to the following criteria:
-

Differences between visitor groups (single expert versus single novice)

-

Typical contrasting examples

-

Demonstrate several movement patterns

-

Visitors that did not use the digital medium, for reasons of comparability with the
MET study at the Linden-Museum

Hence I selected one expert (E1) and one novice (N3) as representatives.

Phase four:
Phase four of data analysis examined the influence of the M3 in the “nexus” exhibition on
movement patterns and the cognitive processes. This time I chose the visitors who used the
M3 and looked for exemplary situations that demonstrate the influence of the M3 across one
expert (E4) and one novice (N6).

6.2. Generalizability of the Movement Patterns
I will provide examples of all movement patterns detected in phase one of analysis at the
“nexus” exhibition as evidence for a possible generalizability of the movement patterns across
different kind of exhibitions. Note that there are some differences between the movement
patterns lists of the two MET studies as you can see in Table 14. For comparison between the
two MET studies I provide video examples of all movement patterns identified in the “nexus”
exhibition at the LiMo on a DVD.
The list of movement patterns identified in the “nexus” exhibition contains movement
patterns in bold print. These were identified in the first phase of data analysis. The aim was to
confirm the 18 movement patterns of the first MET study in the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart. Some
movement patterns do not occur in the “nexus” exhibition as mentioned in Table 14 due the
179

affordances of the exhibition design. The movement patterns in italic and bold print were
identified for the first time in the second phase of analysis. The aim of this second phase was
to identify new movement patterns in the “nexus” exhibition.
Note that even this extended list is probably incomplete. I expect the occurrence of further
movement patterns in other exhibitions. Nevertheless this extended list is probably presenting
the main movement patterns in exhibitions. Hence these movement patterns are presenting the
emic point of viewing exhibitions in its great variability. All movement patterns are
reciprocally excluded.

Table 14: Table of Movement Patterns in the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo

The MET study in the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo validated nearly all movement patterns
that were found in the MET study in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western
Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart. A few behaviours were not observed:
(i) “Fixation Walk”, (ii) “Text Panel Reading” and (iii) “Insights”. (i) “Fixation Walks” were
not possible because all exhibits were displayed in display cabinets, which were almost all in
a homogenous presentation except the last row displaying relics. Hence no salient features
183

could be detected that would lead to a “Fixation Walk” towards an exhibit from far away. (iii)
“Text Panel Reading” was not possible because there are no text panels or any other further
information provided on the display level of the “nexus” exhibition at all. (iii) “Insights” were
not possible because all exhibits are displayed within display cabinets and there was no
exhibit with a hole presenting inner parts.
In addition the MET study in the “nexus” exhibition found further movement patterns: (i)
“Pull Back”, (ii) “Reading in Exhibits”, (iii) “Reading the M3” and further “Alternating
Gazes” – such as “Alternating Gazes” (iv) between display cabinets, (v) within an exhibit and
(vi) between M3 and exhibit. (i) “Pull Back” is performed due to the attraction power of an
exhibit, which pulls the gaze back to the exhibit although the visitor was already close to
leaving. (ii) “Reading in Exhibits” is probably especially characteristic for literature
exhibitions or any other exhibition that displays manuscripts, typo scripts, letters and books or
any other readable exhibits. (iii) “Reading the M3” is especially characteristic for exhibitions
that provide a tablet-like medium or any other media that provides text. Further “Alternating
Gazes” like (iv) the “Alternating Gazes” between display cabinets are performed due to the
affordance of comparison created by the rows of display cabinets. (v) “Alternating Gazes”
within an exhibit are characteristic for exhibits with more than one part like books that feature
texts and pictures. (vi) “Alternating Gazes” between the M3 and an exhibit are especially
characteristic for an exhibition visit with a digital guide. Thus digital guides change the
movement behaviour of visitors due to increased eye-hand coordination; especially with tablet
like guides.
Again the newly identified movement patterns reveal the distinctive appropriation of the
characteristic affordances of the “nexus” exhibition: multi-partitioned exhibits that can be
appropriated and compared within themselves. Additionally the homogenous display cabinets
themselves can be compared with each other. Thereby these homogenous display cabinets
display exhibits that show their greatness only when viewed from shorter distances and hence
pull back the attention from close distances and not from far away. Furthermore the digital
guide M3 provides the only information about these exhibits. Hence exhibits can be compared
with the M3.
Besides these aspects the characteristics of completely glassy display cabinets provide more
action possibilities like the “Pull Back” from the side of the display cabinet back to the front
184

like it is presented in the MET video example. Further movement patterns are more likely due
to this presentation with glassy shelves. For example a “Zooming Closer” from distantly
shelves to a lower or higher shelves. A “Changing Perspective” includes a movement to the
viewable bottom side of an exhibit due to glassy shelves. An “Alternating Gaze” can be
performed around the corner of a display cabinet, for example looking from the side to the
front and back again.
In sum, the appropriation by particular movement patterns is adjusted to the particular
affordances of this exhibition with completely glassy display cabinets presenting almost
completely homogenous exhibits. The distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns
found in both MET studies presumably can be identified also in further visitor studies.

6.3. Exemplary Movement Patterns and Cued Retrospective Reporting of One Expert
and One Novice without M3 Usage
After verifying the movement patterns in a completely different exhibition, I want to examine
exemplarily the differences between experts and novices viewing and processing the “nexus”
exhibition. Therefore I will provide examples of experts and novices that did not use the M3.
According to a detailed description, I will provide the viewing behaviour recorded by the
MET with still images out of the mobile eye tracking video data and the cognitive processes
described in the CRR with the respective transcripts. Hence the reader is able to get an
impression of the particular movement patterns and the respective cognitive processes that go
along with it in the course of the complete circulation through “nexus”.
First, the dwell time by experts and novices is similar except for the dwell time of the visitor
“N2” (see Table 15):

Table 15: Dwell time of experts and novices without M3 usage in the “nexus” exhibition at
the LiMo

I will compare exemplarily visitor “E1” with visitor “N3” regarding on-topic examples of
their complete circulation in “nexus”. These two visitors are typical candidates for their group
and show contrasting viewing behaviour and cognitive processes:
Remember that E1 is a male expert visitor who is a teacher trainee for German and 23 years
old. E1 is interested in German literature and in literature museums. N3 is a male technician
for machine tools for a well-known German automaker in Stuttgart. N3 is 43 years old and
only a little interested in German literature and not interested at all in literature museums.

Conclusion: 6. Design/presentation practice
Both visitors (expert and novice visitor) report about their reactions to and their
assessment of the glassy shelves in the display cabinets. Both criticized the highest
and the lowest level (see Figures 91, 92, 95 and 96).

General Conclusion between One Expert and One Novice without M3 Usage
At this point, I must state that between experts and novices who did not use the M3, the
novice does not report as much as the expert even though the novice visitor N3 spends more
time in “nexus” than the expert visitor E1. Hence the quantity of time spent in exhibitions is
not always equal with the quality of processing exhibitions. Furthermore the quantity of the
time spent does not seem to be a matter of expertise but probably the quantity and quality of
reporting and hence more elaborate processing does.
Although the novice visitor only attends to bits and pieces, he identifies two important
intentions of the curators, whereas the expert looks for the big picture of “nexus” and the
pedagogical aspects of the exhibition. That is probably why there are fewer characteristic
movement patterns that refer to the cognitive processes of the expert. Note that the expert
visitor performs a lot of “Window Shopping” and “Minor Orientation Gazes”. This provides
further evidence that “Window Shopping” works as a search strategy like Rounds assumed in
his search rules that are characterized by “initial scanning mechanism” (2004: 401).
Additionally the increase in “Window Shopping” and “Minor Orientation Gazes”
demonstrates the main affordance and thus the main way of appropriating the nexus
exhibition. It seems as though “nexus” affords more scanning movement patterns due to the
rows of homogenous display cabinets.
Furthermore, the novice visitor mainly selects relicts of the fourth row; in contrast the expert
mainly selects exhibits that are connected to the Nazi regime, although the “nexus” exhibition
does not focus on historical events. The chronological order provides possibilities to look for
such events. As Habsburg-Lothringen (2012) pointed out correctly, there are possibilities for
creating narrations due to the chronological order (see Chapter 3). The reading of the selected
201

exhibits also shows the level of expertise. Whereas the expert again looks for the big picture
(the decontextualizing of the exhibits), the novice is more concerned about the immediate
profane situation of his visit (the readability of the exhibits).
Regardless of their level of expertise, the expert and the novice visitors share one critique
about “nexus”. Both visitors are unhappy about the shelves below and above eye-level within
the display cabinets. The expert visitor even compared the shelves of the display cabinets with
shelves in a supermarket. Although museum staff is probably not fond of such a comparison,
Eghbal-Azar et al. (2016) provide further evidence that the expert is somehow right, at least
for the behaviour of the visitors. They also found evidence that exhibits on eye-level were
accessed more in the museums guide M3, like consumer research found in supermarkets
(Chandon, Hutchinson, Bradlow, & Young 2009, Drèze, Hoch, & Purk 1994).
In sum, the appropriation of nexus is largely dependent on the visitor’s agenda as Falk et al.
(1998) already pointed out. Thus being a German teacher trainee or working as a technician
for machine tools for an automaker shaped the appropriation of nexus and the experience with
“nexus”. Furthermore there are references that the appropriation and experience of “nexus”
are also a matter of expertise. Expertise leads to a more elaborate processing that seeks the big
picture of the exhibition.
Based on the general conclusion about one expert and one novice visitor, the design
suggestions are:
(i) If you want your visitors to know the exhibition’s theme right from the beginning of their
visit instead of searching for it, either provide an initial introduction, the big picture, the
theme, or the intentions of your exhibition at the entrance.

(ii) To maintain the interest of your visitors and avoid “museum fatigue”, provide a
heterogeneous range of exhibits for various exhibit selection opportunities that reflect the
interests of your target audience group(s).

(iii) Thus better keep your target audience (experts or novices) in mind when you create and
design your exhibition.

202

(iv) If you want visitors’ to view your highlight exhibits, put your highlights on eye-level or
risk that they will not be attended.

(v) If you want to avoid confusion of display – as the misperception of the novice visitor
demonstrates – avoid too many levels of glassy shelves.

6.4. Exemplary Movement Patterns and Cued Retrospective Reporting of One Expert
and One Novices with M3 Usage
After providing exemplary the differences in behaviour and cognitive processing between one
expert and one novice who do not use the digital medium M3, I want to examine exemplarily
the differences between experts and novices who use the M3. Again according to a detailed
description, I will describe the viewing behaviour recorded by the MET with still images out
of the MET video data and the cognitive processes described in the CRR with the respective
transcripts. Hence the reader is able to get an impression of the particular movement patterns
and the respective cognitive processes that go along with it.
Before going into details, let us look at the dwell time of the expert and novice visitors in the
“nexus” exhibition with M3 usage (see Table 25):
Visitors with M3

Dwell Time

E4

49:48 min.

E5

83:37 min.

N6

08:28 min.

N7

46:43 min.

Table 16: Dwell time of experts and novices with M3 usage in the “nexus” exhibition at the
LiMo

M3 usage seems to lead to a longer dwell time (compare table 15 with table 16). Note that
visitor E5 desperately wanted to visit the exhibition longer than the MET device can record.
203

Hence we calibrated the MET a second time and the visitor visited the exhibition twice. The
83:37 min. is the addition of the first visit with 47:20 dwell time in the exhibition and the
second visit with 36:17 min. Note that the Locarna MET can record one hour including
partially the time of preparation and the time of moving to the exhibition.
Why did the novice visitor N6 visit the “nexus” exhibition only for a few minutes although he
used the M3? To find out I will compare exemplary novice visitor N6 with expert visitor E4
(as his behaviour seems to be more typical than the behaviour of expert visitor E5 who was
the only visitor who visited the exhibition twice). Remember E4 is a male expert visitor who
has a master degree in German studies and is 27 years old. E4 is completely interested in
German literature and completely interested in literature museums. N6 is a male novice visitor
who studies software engineering and is 24 years old. N6 is interested in German literature
and only a little interested in literature museums.

This is a parade example of
“technology fatigue” in exhibitions
(cf. Filippini-Fantoni & Bowen 2008).

In sum, two steps seem to be crucial in activating the M3 properly. Firstly, to
activate the log in to “nexus” itself and secondly, to activate a single display cabinet
menu.

between the exhibit and its label (see
Figures 128-136). In the first example
this led to a further investigation using
the information provided by the M3
(see Figure 128-133). In the second
example the difference between exhibit
and label was recognized only after the
visit while viewing the visitor’s own
video (see Figure 136). Although the
expert visitor mentioned elsewhere that
he selected exhibits mainly by the label,
he chose the second example for its own
sake (see Figure 134).
Both examples also show that “Reading
in Exhibits” and “Reading the M3” is
complementary and not exclusively the
one or another, probably due to the
closeness of the M3 at the exhibit.
Both examples show a deeper cognitive

processing and thus aesthetic
experience. The “Glass Bead Game”
example is also a vivid example for the
curator’s intention to show that
literature is constructed.
Remarkably the expert visitor describes
the M3 as an integral impartation
medium when he defines it as
“electronic secondary literature”.

General Conclusion between One Expert and One Novice with M3 Usage
In sum, M3 usage prolongs the dwell time in general. Eghbal-Azar et al. (2016) found further
evidence about this prolongation after conducting an observation study in “nexus”. They
demonstrated that M3 usage prolonged the visit in the “nexus” exhibition by 60% (16 min.) in
general. This MET study moves a bit further toward the qualitative data. Namely, that the
prolongation of the dwell time depends on the media competence or the social competence to
organize help and a high frustration tolerance. If visitors manage to handle the M3 properly,
then M3 usage prolongs the dwell time in the “nexus” exhibition. If visitors do not manage to
handle the M3 properly, then it may lead to an early termination of the visit. At least,
“technology fatigue” can play a crucial role (cf. Filippini-Fantoni & Bowen 2008).
Note about all four visitors who used the M3, novice visitor N6 told me that he took part in
the visitor study because he was curious about the MET. Thus, his agenda was driven by this
curiosity. Note also that novice visitor N6 was not the only visitor who activated the audio
guide tours. The other novice visitor N7 also managed to login to “nexus” himself and
selected an audio guide tour (“For Readers”; German “Für Leser”) and later another one (“For
Onlookers”; German “Für Schaulustige”). As N7 could not find the mentioned exhibits, he
was also annoyed and interrupted his M3 usage for a few minutes. Later he tried once again
by himself via the help menu. After struggling with finding the position of the login for the
display cabinets, he enjoyed using the M3 very much. As we saw, the expert visitor E4 asked
for help, in contrast expert visitor E5 ran the M3 by himself very quickly.
221

The expert visitors mentioned repeatedly that they selected the exhibits mainly by the author
name mentioned in the exhibit label – the code made of year and author name. This is in line
with the findings by Eghbal-Azar et al. (2016). They figured out that the popularity of the
author names lead to more accesses in the M3. The exhibit selection of the expert visitor E4
demonstrates that the M3 not only is intended as an integral impartation medium but that it
really works as one in practice as long as you succeed in activating it. It leads to a deeper
appropriation by further particular movement patterns. Contrary to the audio guide at the
Linden-Museum in Stuttgart, which leads to a parallel appropriation and listening at the same
time, the M3 usage without audio guide function leads to a separate appropriation of exhibits
or M3, thereby both kinds of appropriation are complementary and not exclusive. Hence M3
usage leads to further movement patterns as demonstrated in the list of movement patterns in
the “nexus” exhibition (see Table 6.2). Visitors even embody or incorporate the M3 as their
“electronic secondary literature” device when visiting the “nexus” exhibition, provided they
manage to handle it. Their museum experience is broadened by the haptic sense as the M3
allows visitors to ‘touch’ the exhibits indirectly and virtually. In sum, with M3 usage the
experience of “nexus” is more exhaustive and leads to a more elaborate processing and
haptic/emotional moments as the “Glass Bead Game” example and the note of Hilde Domin
experience demonstrate. This is in line with findings by Schwan et al. (2008) that tablets can
lead to more intense involvement with the exhibition’s content.
Furthermore I asked all the visitors who used the M3 which potentials and limitation the M3
has. The expert visitors (E4 and E5) both appreciated that the M3 contains the information
and that this information is optional according to the visitors’ needs; thus text panels and
textual exhibits did not interfere with each other. This conclusion is in line with the intention
of the curators that text and textual exhibits should not compete with each other. Accordingly
the M3 is the only source of information in the “nexus” exhibition. Expert E4 additionally
criticizes the heavy weight of the M3 and thinks that the M3 handling must be shown to the
visitors. Novice visitor N6 is not fond of the M3. He thinks the M3 has no advantages; on the
contrary, he thinks that he would have probably visited the exhibition for longer if he did not
use the M3. Novice visitor N7 appreciates the connecting functions but criticizes the login to
the display cabinets and the picture function that does not show the picture of an exhibit
according to the screen size.

222

Based on the general conclusion about one expert and one novice visitor using the M3 and the
personal evaluation of all four M3 users, the design suggestions are as follows:
(i)

If you want your visitors to stay longer in your exhibition and engage with it more
elaborately, provide digital guides.

(ii)

For an easier handling of the digital guide, keep your digital guide light. On the
one hand, this advice is meant in the literal sense of the word: the weight of your
guide should be light. On the other hand, it is meant in a metaphorical sense: the
handling should be light, thus easy.

(iii)

Easy handling could be accomplished by automatic self-localization of the digital
guide or by help information that is automatically given by the digital guide right
at the start of the visit or by self-explanatory guidance. Due to the out-dated M3
technology, Marbach’s museums – the LiMo and the Schiller-Nationalmuseum –
introduced an app for smartphones that provides further information for visitors
before, during and after their visit. In this context the LiMo put a new permanent
exhibition on display called “Die Seele” (“The soul”).

(iv)

The LiMo succeeded in training their museum attendants to provide information
about the structure of “nexus” and how the M3 works. Thus train your museums
attendants about how you want them to inform about your exhibition and do not
muzzle museum attendants.

(v)

Nevertheless, the M3 only works as the only source of information and thus as an
integral impartation guide, if the visitors manage to handle it.

6.5. Conclusion
This chapter had four aims. Firstly, it wanted to demonstrate that the 18 distinct movement
patterns found in the first MET study in the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the West
Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart can also be identified in a completely
different exhibition like the literature exhibition “nexus” at the LiMo. The MET study in the
“nexus” exhibition validated nearly all 18 movement patterns. Secondly, the MET study in the
“nexus” exhibition found further movement patterns due to altered affordances caused by the
almost purely homogenous presentation of multi-partitioned exhibits that show their greatness
223

only when viewed from shorter distances and not from far away. Additional movement
patterns were also found due to the altered affordance caused by the digital medium M3 that
provides the only information about these exhibits as well as the completely glassy display
cabinets. The appropriation by these further particular movement patterns such as more forms
of “Alternating Gazes” and more forms of reading, and no “Fixation Walks” but instead “Pull
Backs”, is adjusted to these particular affordances. In sum, the distinct, recurrent and
systematic movement patterns found in both MET studies are likely characteristically for
appropriating exhibitions in general. Thus they represent the emic point of viewing
exhibitions.
Thirdly, this chapter aimed to provide further insights into the differences of movement
behaviour and cognitive processes between experts and novices. I can provide evidence that
time spent is not a matter of expertise and that the quantity of time spent does not necessarily
lead to a better quality of processing the viewed exhibits. Novices seem to be more interested
in artefacts. They attend only to bits and pieces and are more concerned about their immediate
profane situation. In contrast, experts in German studies are not necessarily interested in
manuscripts and are concerned with the intention and the big picture of an exhibition. Hence,
the appropriation and experience of an exhibition seem to be largely dependent on the level of
expertise. Of course, the level of expertise correlates somehow and sometimes with the
visitor’s agenda when visiting an exhibition.
Additionally, it became clear that the two visitor groups – experts and novices – are
heterogeneous. Some experts have more expertise than other experts. For example, expert
visitor E1 who is a German teacher trainee seeks pedagogical consequences of the “nexus”
exhibition. Other experts are philologists and not interested in the pedagogical consequences
of the literature exhibition “nexus”. It seems that students of philology, the friends of speech –
no matter what kind of philology – are more devoted themselves to “nexus” and its literary
exhibits (like manuscripts and books) than other expert visitors, even more so than students
that are becoming teacher trainees for German. A common feature of all participating visitors
studying philology is that they remember more author names than the other participating
visitors. They remember even more author names than teacher trainees for German. Hence it
seems that there are different kinds of experts. As the expert visitor E1 declared, “nexus” is
not an exhibition for ordinary experts like German teacher trainees but rather for sophisticated
experts like literary scholars.
224

Like in the MET study at the Linden-Museum I did not collect further data about the experts
and novices. This limitation of these two MET studies must be considered in further studies.
Hence, this only allows cautious conclusions about experts and novices. Furthermore this
inconsistency within the expert group and the novice group makes it difficult to compare
experts and novices as planned but at the same time this is an important result: “nexus” is an
exhibition for experts with more sophisticated expertise like “literary scholars”. Thus, HansJoachim Klein is probably right that exhibiting literature is far more difficult and is only
interesting for an expert audience (2001; see Chapter 2).
Fourthly, this chapter aimed to provide insights into the influence of the digital medium M3
on movement behaviour and cognitive processing in the “nexus” exhibition. The MET study
in the “nexus” exhibition provides evidence that a prolonged dwell time is mainly a matter of
M3 usage and less a matter of expertise about the exhibition issues. One might suppose that
the novice visitor N6 should be able to handle the M3 properly as he studies software
engineering and hence is an expert for software. Eghbal-Azar et al. (2016) provide
quantitative evidence about the prolonged dwell time regarding M3 usage. However the MET
study moves a step further and demonstrates qualitatively that M3 usage only prolongs the
visit as long as the visitor is able to activate and handle the M3 properly, which implies
succeeding in several steps of activation and thus overcoming several difficulties. Two steps
seem to be crucial: Firstly, activating the log in to “nexus” itself and secondly, activating a
single display cabinet menu.
Furthermore Eghbal-Azar et al. (2016) shown that only a third of the visitors are naturally
using an M3 at all, whereas they only use it in 44 % of their stops and stop at fewer display
cabinets. Hence M3 users behave more selectively than non-users. They also provide
evidence that the selection of an exhibit in the M3 is only made after several steps of
selecting, nearing and examining the exhibit itself have already been made. Selecting an
exhibit in the M3 is therefore the last step in the selection process. The MET study provides
examples of particular viewing behaviour and the cognitive processes that go along with it
and thus provides insights about this last step in the selection process of exhibits. M3 usage
separates gaze and attention between exhibit and information level like a text panel but it does
not lead to a zombie-like behaviour. In contrast it leads to more distinct movement patterns
and hence a more elaborate appropriation of the exhibition. Due to the embodiment of the M3
in visiting the “nexus” exhibition, the museum experience is broadened by the haptic sense of
225

touch the M3 that allows visitors to ‘touch’ the exhibits indirectly and virtually. Thus, as
mentioned above, M3 usage leads to a more exhaustive the experience of “nexus” and to
haptic/emotional moments.
The two examples of exhibit selection in the M3 by the expert visitor in the MET study show
that the stops on earlier display cabinets like in the manuscript row and the book row and
popular author names play a crucial role. Other reports of MET study participants also point
to the fact that popularity of author names is guiding the exhibit selection process. Both are in
line with the findings by Eghbal-Azar et al. (2016) who reported though statistical analyses of
the content management data of the M3 that the vertical and horizontal position, size, and
authenticity of exhibits and the popularity of author names play important roles in selection
processes. Furthermore the MET study finds another reason for exhibit selection in the M3:
cognitive dissonance between an exhibit and its label, which leads to an increased interest in
further information provided by the M3.
In sum, the affordances of the “nexus” exhibition are same but different as the affordances
of the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition. The
affordances of these exhibitions are the same insofar as most of the movement patterns could
be identified in both exhibitions. At the same time the affordances of these exhibitions are
different insofar as some movement patterns could not be identified (“Fixation Walk”,
“Reading Text Panels” and “Insights”) but further movement patterns were identified in the
“nexus” exhibition (“Pull Back”, “Reading in Exhibits”, “ Reading the M3” and more forms
of “Alternating Gazes”). Thus the appropriation of “nexus” by particular movement patterns
changed due to the changed affordances of the almost homogenous presentation of multipartitioned exhibits that have to be examined from a short distance, due to the completely
glassy display cabinets and due to the provided digital guide M3 with its integral information
function.
Thus M3 usage leads to more distinct movement patterns and more variability of movement
patterns as far as there are more forms of “Alternating Gazes” and more forms of reading in
this exhibition. In general, the appropriation of the “nexus” exhibition is characterized by a lot
more “Window Shopping” and “Minor Orientation Gazes” as scanning strategies from close
distances. Furthermore, the appropriation of this exhibition by particular movement patterns
depends on the levels of expertise and hence the agenda of the visit, as the MET study at the
Linden-Museum showed. Consequently, the experience of the “nexus” exhibition is largely
226

shaped by the homogenous presentation, the popular author names that are recognized, the
integral digital guide M3 that provides further optional information for a further cognitive
processing of the exhibits and the level of expertise with higher levels leading to more
elaborate processing.
Thus, the summarized design suggestions are as already mentioned above:
(i)

If you want your visitors to stay longer in your exhibition and deal with it more
elaborately provide a digital guide.

(ii)

Better keep your visitors orientated because they seek orientation.
a. Thus provide clear initial information and titling of the exhibition at the
entrance.
b. Provide clear signs or signifiers for orientation like the numbers of the display
cabinets and the log in to them.
c. Put all these information and important exhibits on eye-level, if you want your
visitors to recognize them.

(iii)

Note that a heterogeneous display is favoured, especially by novice visitors.

(iv)

If you use digital guides, especially multimedia guides, keep your technology
updated and make it as light (weight and handling) as possible.

(v)

If you want to avoid confusion of display, avoid too many levels of glassy shelves.

(vi)

Finally, better be aware of your target audience.

So far, I reported the empirical results of this thesis. Before drawing general conclusions from
the complete research, the next chapter will critically reflect on all applied methods with the
main focus on MET and observation.

227

7. Critical Reflection on the Applied Methods in Visitor Studies and Anthropological
Field Research in General
Applying a new method like mobile eye tracking (MET) in visitor studies and cultural
anthropology as well as triangulating methods requires a careful methodological reflection
before one draw conclusions about the research results. Apart from the particular
methodological problems mentioned in the respective chapters, the applied methods have
several potentials, limitations and prospects and lead to several reactions. This reflection is
mainly concerned with my own research experiences. As limitations of one method can be
linked with the potential of the other and vice versa, these two aspects are discussed together.
The reaction section describes reactions from colleagues, cooperation partners, staff members
of the museums, participating visitors as well as one reaction of the German press. At last, the
prospects section works as a conclusion about the methods’ worth and future. I will describe
each aspect for each method as well as the triangulation of them. However, I will mainly
focus on MET as a new method because this might be of special interest for social scientists.
As a reminder the applied methods were as follows: (i) MET, (ii) cued retrospective reporting
(CRR), (iii) interviews, (iv) systematic observation, (v) field notes about the own experience
with the exhibition and the research process and (vi) documentation of the exhibitions.

7.1. Potentials and Limitations
Anticipating the prospects, I shall go on to suggest MET as a new feasible but complementary
method for social scientists conducting field research. With MET we can “grasp for the
native’s point of view” (Malinowski 1922: 25) in its very literal sense. Before exploring this
point, I shall illustrate some of the typical problems of this technology with reference to my
use of MET in visitor studies. Based on these limitations, I will discuss the other methods that
were combined with MET or were triangulated with it.
Mayr et al. (2009: 198-200) list eight limitations of MET:
1. No recording of “covert attention and mental spotlight” since eye fixations per se do not tell
us anything about the goal of the participant’s attention.
2. Only “limited conclusions about cognitive processing” are possible because the conclusions
that we arrive at through MET are typically “interpretations of eye-tracking data that are often
228

based on assumptions and heuristics about underlying cognitive processes” (Mayr et al. 2009:
198).
3. Some “obtrusiveness of measurement”, as data might be distorted because participants are
aware of being evaluated by the MET or are irritated by wearing it.
One expert visitor in the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo even reported about socially desired
behaviour wearing a MET:

“By the way, one should provide an eye-tracker for each visitor, and
then he would certainly view the exhibits in more detail. Yes, that is
automatically like this…I do not know how this is called in science now
of course but there is certainly a rate that differs then. In that sense that
the participant knows that he is examined and that is why he/this rate
behaves differently as if he would not know”.

In terms of visitor research, participation in such a study changes the agenda that is driving
visitors’ behaviours (cf. Falk et al. 1998).
4. “Selective sampling” in the sense that not everyone can wear a MET device since
participants with corneal dysfunctions (that prohibit reflections of the infrared lights) or who
wear regular glasses are disqualified (since the publication of Mayr et al. 2009 devices have
become available, e.g., from Locarna, that allow wearing regular glasses in addition to the eye
tracker.)
5. “Limited temporal and spatial accuracy” occurs because there is (currently) a time
limitation due to the temporal resolution of eye-trackers that must be divided for the recording
of two videos at the same time (hence 50 Hz in fact mean 25 Hz), so that very short fixations
might be missed. If distances between the participant and objects often differ from the
calibrated distance, then the spatial accuracy is not given at all times (p. 199; the parallax
error see above). Like all lens cameras, the scene camera only records one part of the world
and is more limited in scope than our vision.
6. “Laborious data analysis” is required in regard to eye movement patterns, like they were
investigated in this research, because such data analysis still must be done largely manually
229

by the researcher. This limitation is due to the mobile setting that allows visitors to walk
individually through galleries so that the stimuli and scenes change all the time. We may add
here that this apparent disadvantage also provides some advantages because manual analysis
includes possibilities for the researchers who are free to define what duration is counted as a
fixation and how to classify scan patterns. If this were done automatically, then we would lose
an opportunity for altering parameters and comparing results and potentially gaining new
insights in the process. In the meantime some devices include software that allows some semiautomatic analysis. For example the Locarna PT Mini provides the annotator tagging tool and
the SMI Eye Tracking Glasses provides the BeGaze software in 2010 or the Austrian
Pflegervision company even provide automatic analysis while recording data in 2015.
However, it is likely that researchers will always want to do some analysis manually for the
reasons just mentioned (see Eghbal-Azar & Widlok 2013 for a calculation of the enormous
amount of time for manual MET data analysis).
7. Costs were a limitation. METs were very expensive at the time of data collection in 2010
(each of the devices we used in our study costs around 25,000 Euro; binocular METs were
sold at around 40,000 Euro). In the meantime in 2015 MET are much cheaper, some new
binocular MET are sold around 10,000 Euro.
8. New “ethical concerns” because participants can hardly manipulate or hide their eye
movements and this point must be included in procedures of consent. At the same time the
accurate recording of eye movements is one of the important assets of this technology.
Furthermore, my research shows that you have to keep up with MET technology. The ASL
MobileEye was already four years old when I applied it in the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum. For example it was more
difficult to calibrate and could not cope with darkness as well as the Locarna PT Mini that I
applied in the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo.
Additionally, when applying the older technology, I faced a lot of noise in the video recording
in the form of image interferences at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart. This noise was not
replicable at other places like the LiMo or the Knowledge Media Research Centre. This can
be explained technically due to eye blinks (Duchowski 2003: 119) or the outdated technology
of the ASL MobileEye. It could also be explained humorously as noise of ancestors who are
linked with exhibits (see 6.2. Reactions). I also lost data due to inexplicable technical
230

problems. However, in the end, when you are using technology you run the risk of technical
problems.
Mayr et al. (2009) suggest combining MET with other methods such as interviews,
questionnaires, or verbal reports to gain valid interpretations of scan patterns. One of the
reasons why MET needs to be combined with other methods is that the marker (based on the
eye camera) that is permanently shown in the processed MET video data cannot be equalized
all the time with actual attention to the object or scene captured by the scene camera. While
past research assumed a strong “eye-mind hypothesis” (Just & Carpenter 1980) as though eye
movements would provide a direct insight into cognition, current research does not assume
that we can draw simple conclusions from fixations and scan patterns to the goals of attention
and to the underlying cognitive processes (Mayr et al. 2009; Land & Tatler 2009).
Complementary to MET, there are three different kinds of verbal reporting which may be
selected according to the research question or the task at hand and with respect to the relevant
memory system. These are concurrent, retrospective and cued retrospective reporting (van
Gog, Paas, Merriënboer & Witte 2005, van Someren, Barnard & Sandberg 1994; Ericsson &
Simon 1993):
- Concurrent Reporting means thinking aloud while doing a particular task.
- Retrospective Reporting means verbal reporting in retrospection after completing the task.
- Cued Retrospective Reporting (CRR) means reporting after completing a particular task
with a cue, in this case typically while watching the processed recording. Holmqvist et al.
(2011: 256) describe this technique of “cued retrospective thinking aloud” as an increasingly
common technique “to show the scan path to a participant just after his data has been
recorded, and ask him to retell what he was thinking of during the initial inspection of the
stimulus".
In my own studies, described in Chapters 4 and 6, I chose CRR since it promises to lead to
more exact and controlled results as the given cue (a processed eye-tracking video) triggers
more exact memories which would otherwise be constructed without the assistance of a cue
(van Gog et al. 2005). Another reason for retrospective instead of concurrent reporting was
that concurrent reporting might have led to changes in attention and behaviour.
Potentials of reporting, no matter which one you may choose, are that cognitive processes and
attention processes can be identified. However, it is a laborious method since the reporting
231

must be transcribed and analysed by content analysis. Additionally the combination with
MET affords connecting audio files with the video files as well as further analysis that pays
attention to the connected video-audio data. Falk and Dierking (2000) report that by talking
about displayed issues with other people cognitive processes are initiated. That might well be
the case with CRR. Hence CRR probably leads to a deeper elaboration of the viewed
exhibition.
Additionally, I combined MET with field notes and interviews. Interviews were indispensable
for identifying social data. The analytical effort depends on the kind of questions with open
questions leading to more effort. There are still many questions that have not been analysed
yet and that do not contribute to the main issues of this thesis. In the end, less is more. Instead
of being too ambitious, I should have been more focused.
Finally yet importantly, the writing of field notes was a complementary method during the
whole research process, especially immediately around the time the studies took place.
However, writing field notes interrupted the observation. Attention shifted from observing to
writing. Finally field notes have to be processed for further analysis like any other data, which
can be labour-intensive. Otherwise they are not expedient and only anecdotal.
Writing field notes definitely helped me gain insights about the real motivation of exhibition
visits and participation in the MET study, which sometimes was the MET technology itself. It
also helped me identify disinterests, namely disinterest in literature and literature exhibitions,
in addition to the interests explicitly asked in the interview. Additionally, writing field notes
definitely helped me reflect on the applied methods and the reactions to them as described in
this chapter.
The results of the MET study combined with reporting, interviews and field notes were
confirmed by systematic observation. In contrast to the MET studies, the systematic
observation study was conducted unobtrusively. The observer was usually identified as
another museum attendant who was sitting around in the gallery to take care of the exhibits.
Hence it did not lead to much distortion in visitor behaviour. Furthermore there was no
selective sampling. Everyone can potentially be observed no matter whether visitors wear
glasses or have corneal dysfunctions. Data analysis can be kept to a minimum once
technology is used in collecting data. The costs are low unless such technology is used.
Finally ethical concerns are more common than with MET.
232

Nevertheless, like MET, systematic observation (i) does not tell us anything about the goal of
the visitor’s attention per se and therefore should also be combined with interviews or
different forms of reporting or field notes as well. I combined systematic observation with
retrospective reporting directly after observation at the respective section at least for a subset
of observed visitors.
Furthermore, like MET, systematic observation (ii) by itself does not allow for conclusions
about cognitive processing and (iii) also has limited temporal and spatial accuracy due to the
limited awareness of observers – in case the observation was done spontaneously and not
videotaped – and due to the observer’s position to the observed visitor. In this regard the
amount of visitors is crucial. Neither is the absence of visitors desirable nor having too many,
because no visitors means no data and too many visitors means an obstructed view. An
obstructed view can occur due to darkness and reflective lights or due to the exhibition design
itself, such as other exhibits or display cabinets being between the observer and observed
visitors. Such was the situation in the “nexus” exhibition. That is why it was impossible to
conduct a systematic observation study about movement patterns on the same level as in the
“South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition. Moreover “Other
Movement Patterns” were rarely detected by observation. Concentrating on 15 different
movement patterns at the same time is already difficult enough for the brain, although the
observation sheet was formatted according to possible chunking of movement patterns. Being
open for further new movement patterns is overloading the observer’s brain, in case the
observation was done spontaneously and not videotaped as mentioned above. Likewise an
external observer is likely focusing more on obvious affordances and movement patterns.
Plus (iv) systematic observation, as opposed to the highly used participant observation, does
not provide data that emerge from the field itself but instead of the researcher’s brain. Hence
issues that might never come up in the researcher’s mind are therefore not identifiable with
systematic observation (for an extended description and discussion of systematic observation
compared to participant observation see Beer 2003: 119-141).
Now, let us have a look at the assets of MET compared to other methods. In their summary
Mayr et al. (2009: 196-197) list four potentials of MET as a recording device, which can be
taken as a useful point of departure:

233

1. “Data richness” through the inclusion of information about the environment (e.g., other
visitors present, the visibility or approachability of objects and media).
2. High external “data validity” because data is recorded “objectively” by cameras (Mayr et
al. 2009: 196) reducing perspective errors and providing more ecological validity due to
applicability in natural settings.
3. Providing a “non-reactive measurement”, because eye movement can hardly be
manipulated due to its unconsciousness (see above) so that it can be usefully related
independently to conscious reflection (see below).
4. Allowing statistical analysis, depending on the sample size and research question.
Mayr et al. (2009) listed twice as many limitations as potentials of MET for visitor studies.
The first lesson suggested by my research is that it is worthwhile to first discuss the actual
qualities of MET potentials before starting to compare potentials and limitations by simply
counting them. What are, in fact, the benefits of applying MET in my research? After all, the
costs (time, money, energy) are considerable. Is MET really worth doing?
Here are some details of my research that speak to these broad questions:

Detail one:
Eye-movements in action are very rapid (Land & Tatler 2009). For example, a sequence of
one visit to the literature exhibition that lasted about ten seconds included no less than eight
distinct movement patterns that the MET recorded. There is no way that applying
conventional observation methods without videotaping could record such a large number of
rapidly changing behavioural patterns in such a detailed manner over a long period. The
observer is likely to miss some patterns because observation depends on the acute awareness
of the observer (with no rewind option). By contrast, exploratory MET data can be stored and
then analysed repeatedly.

Detail two:
In conventional observation head and body movements can be treated as a proxy for
movement patterns but there are eye movements that are done without moving the head or the
rest of the body which do show up in the MET record but which otherwise would remain
234

undetected (cf. also Mayr et al. 2009). For example we observed an “Alternating Gaze”
between two tiny exhibits that are positioned very close to each other so that the visitor does
not even have to move his or her head but only the eyes. Without MET these gazes would be
undetected because there are no indicators from which an observer could conclude about the
visitors’ gaze.

Detail three:
Conditions in the museum gallery can make observation difficult or even impossible due to an
obstructed view caused by the particular style of the presentation or simply by too many other
visitors being in the way, as well as by light reflections or by relative darkness. At the LiMo
this forced us to drop conventional observations at the level of objects in close proximity
within the display cabinets in favour of the larger scale only (see Eghbal-Azar et al. 2016),
while the MET allowed us to include the participants’ perspective at all levels. The often
unpredictable and uncontrollable obstructions that make conventional observation difficult
were bypassed by applying MET.

Detail four:
Even when eye movements can be observed, fixations never can due to their very nature (cf.
May et al. 2009). In the example given earlier (in detail one) eight fixations were made within
ten seconds. Two of these eight fixations were directed at a pistol that was exhibited. While
these fixations indicate that attention is being arrested, we still do not know the goal of
attention and the reasons for paying attention until we combine MET data with other methods.
MET therefore also serves a function as an exploratory tool and not just as a tool for
quantifying observations and for testing assumptions as might be expected. It does not
exclude other approaches to aesthetic experiences but it may complement them in interesting
ways.
In sum, it would have been difficult or even impossible to identify and characterize such a
rich and distinct array of movement patterns, if I had not used MET. MET provided very new
insights in the viewing behaviour of visitors. The different frequencies rates between the
observation and the MET study are likely connected to the applied methods and their
characteristics.
235

From these details we may draw some intermediate conclusions, the most important one being
the need for combining MET with other methods. These combinations may be similar to what
Mayr et al. (2009) suggest but other, additional ideas for further possible combinations
emerge from my case material. In my example it was the combination of MET with CRR that
allowed us to say something about the goal of attention: the visitor, in detail four (above) said
“There was a pistol; very interesting” but we still do not know why he was interested in
pistols (in general or in the particular context of this exhibition). To understand this, we need
more information about the individual in question, specifically the type of information that is
usually generated through interview data. In this particular case the given information was not
only about the interest of this visitor but also about his disinterest, namely an apparent
disinterest in literature and its most typical manifestations (such as books, handwritings and
typescripts). Interview data and field diary notes show that the visitor had little exposure to
literature in his school education and professional life. Note that motivation, interest, prior
knowledge and attention are considered necessary factors for informal learning in museums
(Hein, 1998; cf. also Falk et al., 1998 about visitors’ agendas). Information about these highly
relevant aspects cannot be gained through observations alone, be they conventional or
technology-assisted. It is important to underline, therefore, that not only reporting but also
other additional methods should be combined with MET.
Finally yet importantly, all described results would not have been possible without the basic
documentation presented in Chapter 3. This documentation was combined with a detailed
description of the respective exhibitions. Floor plans with photographs help with imagining
the field settings without visiting the exhibitions themselves. Whereas on the one hand
documentation can never replicate the research setting one to one, it is fundamentally
important to correlate the data and to be able to generalize the results on the other hand.
Therefore documentation forms the basis of my empirical research.

7.2. Reactions
Being one of the first researchers who applied MET in visitor studies and being as far as I
know the very first socio-cultural anthropologist who applied MET, I had to face many
prejudices, fears, non-feasible hopes and great lack of knowledge about MET in general and
MET in anthropology and in visitor studies in particular.
236

On the one hand fears were combined with prejudices and lack of information: Kaube (2010)
questioned in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (a major German newspaper) how one
could ever measure gazes in exhibitions that aim to deliver aesthetic experiences. It was also a
point of criticism for the journalist Jürgen Kaube in the FAZ press about our project applying
MET in a literature museum at all. Kaube misunderstood our aims and the value of MET. He
thought we would measure aesthetic experience with MET but instead we were looking for
learning processes. Of course, as a good investigative journalist he should have asked us first
about our aims and how MET really works. Nevertheless Kaube is partially right that, by
applying only MET without combining it with other methods, aesthetical experiences are
hardly measureable. However, below in the conclusion chapter in paragraph 8.1 I will present
an example of MET combined with CRR that even allows first insights into the aesthetical
experience at the beginning of the exhibition visit of a female visitor in the “South Sea Oases:
Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition.
Other anthropologists feared that with MET I could look inside people’s minds as though eye
movements would directly tell me the thoughts of people. Some colleagues confused MET
with video research. Hence they were not aware of the difference between MET and
traditional video research. MET provides the perspective of the visitor and its accurate eye
movements with a fixation cross in the processed video data. In contrast, traditional video
research usually provides the observer’s perspective. Even when it provides the participant’s
perspective, it never provides his/her accurate eye movements.
On the other hand non-feasible hopes combined with lack of knowledge led to the obsession
of colleagues and project partners that afterwards I could tell everybody which exhibits are
really viewed in “nexus”. This was despite the 1300 exhibits, the relative darkness of “nexus”,
which almost prevented any video recording and definitely prevented the identification of
many exhibits, due to an obstructed view caused by glassy display cabinets and ubiquitous
tiny blinding LED lights. Video data of eight visitors had to be analysed manually. Finally
this was despite the fact that viewing exhibits is not an all in one process but rather comprises
several steps from noticing, approaching, stopping, scrutinizing the exhibit and accessing
additional information via text panels, labels or digital guides.
There was hardly any way to keep up with these prejudices during the research process: MET
was either seen as a solution for almost all previous research problems and questions in visitor
studies or as impedance to the museum’s agenda. This shows that not only the participating
237

visitors were wearing goggles but also the various academics being too sceptical on the one
hand and being too enthusiastic on the other.
Who else reacted to the MET studies? First, almost every museum attendant was curious and
uncertain about the MET at the same time. I had to inform all concerned museum attendants
before each research trial that a MET study would be conducted and that the museum
attendants should not interfere with the MET wearing visitor. In this regard single museum
attendants did not follow these instructions. They obstructed the visitor’s pathway and
provided information about the exhibition’s content and structure although they had been
explicitly told not to explain anything. Hence, museum attendants were the main confounding
variable for the MET studies.
The anthropological curators explained the noise/the frequent mysterious image interferences
humorously with reacting ancestors who are linked to exhibits in the “South Sea Oases: Life
and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition. Thus the noise in the video data was
attributed to ancestors who did not want me to record their belongings. Additionally, the
curators, designers and other exhibition makers as well as public relation departments were
open to and interested in the research process and its needs like a calibration room as well as
they were interested in the research results. I definitely do not take this for granted.
Last but not least, the participating visitors also reacted to the MET: some were nervous
during calibration, some were curious about the MET technique, some even took part due to
the MET, some felt uncomfortable wearing it and some even got a headache from wearing it.
One novice visitor even reported about vision interferences due to dirty MET glasses, but the
MET has no glasses. They felt they had vision interference but it was a misperception. At this
point (see Figure 141) he described his vision as:

238

Figure 137: Novice visitor about felt vision interferences
“Exactly like this, I also saw so blurred like now (laughs)”.

As described above as “obtrusiveness of measurement” almost each participating visitor
mentioned that he/she was aware of wearing the MET gear and most of them described their
own behaviour as being largely as usual but neither one described his/her behaviour as
completely usual. The participants reacted to the MET and were aware that their behaviour
was recorded. They even admit this by describing their behaviour only as largely as usual.
Additionally, the CRR that was combined with MET led to reactions by the participating
visitors: some felt uneasy verbalizing in general and some were not sure what and how much
they should verbalize. Enlightening one expert reported about the reporting itself in the
“nexus” exhibition at the LiMo:

“…sometimes I do not have to speak, I think. It is equally in the
exhibition, I do not think about each piece”.

In line with the notion of less is more as mentioned above, the additional interviews in
combination with MET and CRR were simply too much for the participating visitors. They
were already exhausted by calibrating, wearing the MET, viewing the exhibition, reporting
and then whew (!) another task: an extended interview. Even if they weren’t

already
239

experiencing “museum fatigue” and “technology fatigue”, they might start feeling “researchfatigue” by now.
In contrast, field notes and documentation triggered less reaction than the other methods. It
was only noticed that I was writing or documenting. Scientists are probably connected with
writing in the minds of other people. Photographing the exhibit was the only aspect of
documenting that led to concern by the museum attendants. They wanted to be sure that I had
permission for taking photographs, which is their job of course.

7.3. Prospects
After describing the limitations and potentials of the applied methods as well as reactions to
them, I will conclude by discussing their prospects. Besides MET all other applied methods
are well established in the social sciences. Therefore, I will mainly focus on the prospects of
MET as this might be of special interest. Based on the empirical examples given above, I may
revisit the issue of MET potentials and formulate some implications for the field of visitor
studies:
Firstly, equipped with MET data we may reconsider some of the unresolved controversies in
visitor studies. For instance, can we equate stopping or the time spent looking at an exhibit
with attending to this exhibit (Serell 1997, Yalowitz & Bronnenkant 2009)? The visitor who
had given attention to the pistol (which is the only pistol displayed in the literature
exhibition), not only spent time looking at it and fixating on it but reported on it afterwards.
However, there were many other exhibits that he looked at for much longer but without
reporting on them. By applying MET we might be able to conclude that more quantity (length
and number of stops) that we spend looking at exhibits does not necessarily translate into a
qualitative difference of cognitive processing – as Serell (1997) and other visitor researchers
seem to assume. This principle may also apply more generally to exhibitions for that matter.
Secondly, with MET data we may also contribute more specifically to the debates as to i)
whether there is an underlying universal principle that explains the behaviour of visitors

and

ii) whether it consists of the type of behavioural rules that have been previously suggested (cf.
Bitgood 2006 and Rounds 2004). In other words we can discuss whether there is an
“exhibition visit script” – as one may want to call it – for appropriating and experiencing
museum exhibitions. On the basis of MET data, I suggest that it is possible to reconstruct this
240

script “bottom-up” by looking at distinct movement patterns that may form a repertoire of
subscripts from which visitors draw as they combine these subscripts for their complex
navigation strategies that help them to successfully meet the goals and agendas at the
superordinate level (cf. Holmqvist et al. 2011 and cf. Falk et al. 1998). MET data thereby
allows us to flesh out the presumed script and add substance to the assumption that scripts
guide exhibition visits.
On the basis of the MET videos analysis we were able to compile a classificatory list of
distinct, systematic and recurrent movement patterns that may be considered key elements of
a distinct “exhibition visit script”.
This in turn allows us to claim that there is some robustness of this movement pattern list
across different methods of observation and two different exhibitions. This is remarkable
because both exhibitions are very different in many respects so that it is not trivial to ask
whether there is a similar script at work in visits to these two exhibitions. At least these
distinctive movement patterns are very frequent in the way that visitors appropriate and
experience exhibitions. They are good candidates for being part of the larger, general
“exhibition visit script” that researchers have long assumed to be at work without having the
detailed record to show what it consists of.
Although cognitive visitor research defines an exhibition visit as an “open-ended task” (Mayr
et al. 2009: 191.), the motivations attributed to visitors are usually those of informal learning
and receiving information. These appear to be passive strategies given that, in most cases,
visitors are not allowed to act upon objects but only to look at them. By contrast, the MET
data supports the view that visitors are much more active than they otherwise may appear to
be. Visitor research by social scientists tries to accommodate motivations and goals that go
beyond effective information gathering, considering visitors as appropriating and
experiencing exhibitions in an active and embodied fashion (MacDonald 2002: 219).
We can therefore organize our MET observations not only in terms of a list of gazes
employed by visitors looking for information. The observed movement patterns are also
employed as navigation strategies looking for emotional and aesthetic experiences and with
reference to social aspects to do with the presence of other persons as the reporting
demonstrated. Based on these results I think it is plausible (and likely) that an “exhibition
visit script” typically includes a number of navigation strategies and can flexibly
accommodate a spectrum of agendas (see above). With this conclusion I can also deal with
241

scepticism towards MET and criticisms that the inclusion of an "objective" measuring device
risks being reductionist. Applying MET does not entail that exhibition visits are reduced to
information gathering strategies guided by principles of optimality and rational choice (cf.
Bitgood 2006 and Rounds 2004). The observed movement patterns may result from different
– and at times conflicting – motivations and contextual conditions. Milekic (2010) has noted
that MET in visitor studies provokes controversies between the disciplines concerned because
“the major problem in adopting these technologies is the divide that exists between traditional
notions of Art and Science”. We suggest that including the technology into different
interdisciplinary approaches may help to design more integrated research questions and to
arrive at more satisfying answers.
MET in combination with other methods can provide us with new insights into very
individual experiences, appropriation strategies and goals of visitors. It can get us a step
closer towards “strolling and viewing” an exhibition from the visitor’s perspective. It may
also help us to detect and outline unconscious “exhibition visit script(s)” that usually can
hardly be verbalized by the agents themselves. These potential benefits matter to social
scientists because MET opens the door towards an investigation that links unconscious
aspects with socially and culturally constituted forms of embodied knowledge. It adds to our
knowledge about what people look at, what they look for and why (cf. Land & Tatler 2009:
222.).
Cultural schemata and scripts, whether they apply to museum exhibition visits or to other
practices, are notoriously difficult to investigate through external observations or through
videotaping alone. The strength of MET is that it can help to break down fundamental
questions of cognition and practice into very concrete queries such as “What do persons look
at while they are interacting with other persons and why?” “What do persons communicate
with their words and what do they communicate with their eyes?” The answers to such
concrete questions can then be aggregated into more general ones such as “How robust is the
scan pattern that an individual uses to view a particular scene?” and “How similar is this scan
pattern between individuals?”
Thirdly, MET not only generates very detailed and precise data outside the laboratory but it
also allows us to store that data so that it can be analysed again and again quantitatively or
qualitatively with many possible variations depending on the research question. A single MET
recording thereby potentially provides much more data than conventional observation without
242

videotaping. Only due to the application of MET so many distinct movement patterns could
be identified. Of course, as with any other method, MET technology is limited in what it can
provide. For instance, there are technical limitations surrounding the fact that our visual
perception is only partially captured by a camera and that applying MET presupposes the
availability of electronic gadgets under adverse field conditions. Future technical
developments might reduce some of these technical limitations.
In sum, in the social sciences we will want to combine MET with other methods such as field
diary notes, interviews, questionnaires and CRR that provide help when trying to link our
observations to the agents’ goals of attention. MET does not replace the investigator's sense of
understanding the particulars of a research setting; instead, it presupposes such an underlying
understanding because only on this basis can we tune its application to the requirements of the
research context and the particular research question at hand. Applying MET is often
laborious. However, the real challenge is the integration of this technique and the data that it
produces into a social science research schema that by its very nature will always rely on a
number of complementary methods. Triangulating MET with observation verified the MET
results. Although the results would probably be difficultly or hardly derived by mere
observation, observation costs (money, time, energy) are much lower. Hence, I do not expect
that MET technology will completely replace these other forms of observation but that it will
be complementary – in what ways remains to be seen. Nevertheless, I consider MET being an
advantageous and recent method to grasp the native’s point of viewing exhibitions and other
fields in the future.

8. Conclusion
This thesis Affordances, Appropriation and Experience in Museum Exhibitions: Visitors’
(Eye) Movement Patterns and the Influence of Digital Guides was developed within the
interdisciplinary cooperation project Knowledge & Museum: Archive, Exhibit, Evidence
funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The task of my
subproject “Presentation Practice and Evidence Attribution” was to conduct visitor research in
the permanent exhibition “nexus” at the LiMo and in the temporary exhibition “South Sea
Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart. It sought
generalizable results that are also valid in other exhibitions.
This thesis is also based on my personal interest in promoting visitor-centred exhibitions. As a
socio-cultural anthropologist, my goal is to study the underprivileged visitors in museums and
at the same time “to study up” (Naders 1972) (literature) museums at home in Germany.
Conducting visitor studies as a socio-cultural anthropologist involves seeking the emic point
of viewing exhibitions by the visitors and wanting to speak up for them and suggest
improvement in exhibition design by giving detailed design suggestions.
This conclusion is structured into four sections. The first section evaluates the
accomplishment of the aims defined in Chapter 1. The second section works as a short
summary of the main aspects of the three theoretical key terms (affordance, appropriation and
museum experience), provides a complete list of the 26 distinct, recurrent and systematic
movement patterns that were detected in both MET studies and focuses on the influence of
digital guides. The third section provides particular design suggestions based on the research
results of all three visitor studies in both exhibitions. The last section projects the future of
digital guides in exhibitions, the future of MET in visitor studies and social sciences, the new
cognitive science approach and future visitor research.

8.1. Fulfilled Aims
This thesis pursued several aims in each chapter:
Chapter 1 introduced visitor research in general and in socio-cultural anthropology in
particular. It reported about visitor research methods and previous findings about visitor
circulation behaviour and use of digital guides. Additionally it introduced mobile eye tracking
as a new method and presented an overview of the thesis outline.
244

Chapter 2 introduced three main concepts and terms: the “concept of affordance” by Gibson
(1979), my latest notion of appropriation of museums by visitors, and the widely applied term
of museum experience. These three concepts and terms helped to understand and
contextualize the results of this research within the latest theoretical concepts. All three terms
will be summarized in the next paragraph.
Additionally the field of the respective museums and their exhibitions, ethnographic and
literature museums, were introduced as a preparation for the detailed descriptions of the two
research fields in Chapter 3: the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific”
exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart and the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo in
Marbach a. N. Due to these descriptions the reader was able to contextualize the results within
the research setting and was able to transfer the results to other exhibitions.
Chapter 4 sought distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns due to particular
“affordances” (Gibson 1979) in the exhibition design or the exhibit characteristics that were
identified in the first study in the “South Sea Oasis: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific”
exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart. For this research aim the recent method of
MET was applied and combined with CRR to determine the goal of visitors’ attention and the
meaning of the movement patterns. In sum, 18 distinct movement patterns were identified in
this exhibition. Furthermore it was found that expert visitors show a more active viewing
behaviour by performing more and a broader range of movement patterns. Additionally
experts process the viewed exhibition more deeply.
Chapter 5 moved a step further and validated 15 of the 18 identified movement patterns found
in the first MET study using a completely different method, namely systematic observation, in
the same exhibition. The second aim of Chapter 5 was to analyse the influence of an audio
guide on these movement patterns. It demonstrated that audio guide usage leads to a more
active viewing behaviour and to a parallel appropriation by two senses listening and viewing
at the same time.
Chapter 6 moved another step further and used MET to identify the movement patterns found
at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart exhibition in a second, different exhibition: the literature
exhibition “nexus” at the LiMo in Marbach a. N. It validated almost all movement patterns
and in addition, it identified even more distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns
due to the changed affordances according to an almost completely homogenous presentation
in four rows of completely glassy display cabinets that are approachable from various
245

perspectives. In sum, 26 movement patterns were identified altogether. In addition this
chapter investigated the influence of the tablet-like guide ‘M3’ in the “nexus” exhibition at the
LiMo. It found that the usage of the tablet guide evoked further new movement patterns and
led to a deeper cognitive processing of the exhibition.
Chapter 7 critically reflected on the applied methods concerning their potentials, limitations
and prospects in visitor studies and in socio-cultural anthropology as well as regarding the
reactions they trigger. The applied methods were MET, CRR, systematic observation, field
diary notes, interviews and documentation of the two exhibitions. All methods were
connected into a multi-angulation approach. The combination of these methods demonstrated
truly a new cognitive science approach in visitor studies and socio-cultural anthropology
requiring more effort of time and money. Additionally, this chapter provided an informed
basis whether and how social scientists might apply MET-technology in their research.
The aims of Chapter 8 are fulfilled in the next three paragraphs. Thus in sum, all aims were
accomplished.

8.2. Synopsis of Affordances, Appropriation and Experience in Museum Exhibitions
This visitor research not only sought purely empirical results of visitors’ movement
behaviour, it also connected these results with theoretical terms such as affordances (Gibson
1979), appropriation and museum experience.
Affordance is defined by Gibson (1979) as an action possibility inherent in the environment.
This action possibility exists whether a person perceives it or not. It was demonstrated that
perceived affordances lead to particular movement patterns. Explicit differences were found
between freestanding exhibits and display cabinets as well as between homogenous and
heterogeneous display cabinets. Thereby a heterogeneous display cabinet leads to more active
appropriation. It was even demonstrated that some affordances are more likely to be perceived
than others. This was concluded based on the different levels of movement pattern
frequencies. Thus Norman (2013) asserts correctly, that we do need signifiers in design when
affordances are less likely to be perceived.
Furthermore, the most important key term is my novel definition of the appropriation of
exhibits and exhibitions through particular movement patterns. This active embodiment of
exhibitions is characterized by “rolling and strolling” (Korff & Thiemeyer 2008) through
246

exhibitions, which shapes the museum experience. Thus affordance, appropriation and
museum experience form an interconnected theoretical triad upon which my empirical results
are based.
Besides Falk & Dierking’s (2013) “Contextual Model of Learning”, the museum experience
was defined as encompassing the aspects of (i) learning, (ii) aesthetic, (iii) (more or less)
multisensory, (iv) bodily, (v) emotional, (vi) social and (vii) entertaining. Of course, by
applying MET the focus is clearly on the visual sense and the bodily

experience.

Nevertheless, the combined CRR provides not only information about meaning making, and
thus learning, in exhibitions but also the involvement of further senses and aspects in
exploring exhibitions:

Figure 138: Expert visitor enters the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western
Pacific” exhibition

The female expert visitor reported in cued retrospection what she attended to when she was
entering the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition (see
Figure 142):
“First of all, my attention was attracted by the smell of the sea and
salty water. I think this was aesthetic and atmospheric, also the
bickering of the aquarium”.
247

MET in combination with reporting can also provide evidence about aesthetic experiences in
exhibitions, if you seek them. However, of course, pure MET data would not reveal that.
MET instead revealed the following movement patterns in the two different exhibitions.

8.2.1. Visitors’ Movement Patterns: The Complete Master List
In sum, 26 distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns and sub-patterns were
identified in both exhibitions with MET as summarized in Table 17 below. As a point of
departure previous findings by Treinen (1988: “cultural window shopping”), Aleida Assmann
(1995: “long gaze”) and Mayr et al. (2009) were considered when analysing the data. These
patterns were successfully confirmed by the two MET studies in two different exhibitions.
Furthermore, even more distinct, recurrent and systematic movement patterns were identified.
A subset of these movement patterns was successfully confirmed by systematic observation.
Hence the movement patterns are robust across different methods and different field settings.
Note that precisely the differences between these two exhibitions/field sites, mainly
concerning their subject matter and presentation styles, provided a great range of typical
exhibition situations leading to the relatively large number of identified movement patterns.
Accordingly these movement patterns may plausibly be found in further exhibitions.
Thus, concluding about the main aim of this thesis I must state that by applying MET it was
shown that visitors’ viewing behaviours in exhibitions are far more complex than previous
visitor studies have found, such as those that solely applied observation or body tracking.
MET therefore is a very useful method to gain insights about detailed movement patterns of
visitors and thus MET is a useful method to grasp the native’s point of viewing exhibitions.
The complete master list provides all 26 movement patterns and sub patterns. Note that this
list is probably incomplete as I expect the occurrence of further movement patterns in other
exhibitions. Nevertheless this list presents the main movement patterns in exhibitions. All
movement patterns are reciprocally excluded. Furthermore these movement patterns were
classified into four categories of movements that are concerned with orientation, strolling,
exhibits and human beings.

A minor research aim was to determine whether the viewing behaviour and cognitive
processes of content experts and novices between the two MET studies are similar or
different. I found that experts are more actively viewing exhibitions, which means they
perform more and a broader range of different movement patterns and they even react to more
silent affordances than novices. Similar results were found in analysing the CRR: experts also
process the exhibitions more elaborately which means they report a lot more in cued
retrospection than novices. Furthermore experts are more concerned with the exhibition’s
theme and the curatorial intention. In contrast novices are more concerned about their
immediate situation, such as whether they can read literary exhibits properly or the digital
guide works properly.
Furthermore, as mentioned above, it became evident that the professions of the experts and
novices influence their agendas and hence their viewing behaviours and cognitive processes,
with higher levels of expertise leading to more elaborate processing. This echoes the selection
criteria of experts and novices. The only differentiation that was made between them was
based on profession. No further data about the kind of expertise or non-expertise was
collected. Due to the small sample size only cautious conclusions can be made about the
differences and similarities between experts and novices. Sample size is a clear limitation of
the two MET studies that must be considered in further visitor studies.
Upon evaluation, the two visitor groups – experts and novices – are more heterogeneous than
first considered, at least at the literature museum. There are different levels of expertise within
the expert group. In the end, one expert visitor declared correctly that “nexus” is not an
exhibition for ordinary experts like German teacher trainees but rather for sophisticated
experts like literary scholars. Hence, as mentioned above, Hans-Joachim Klein (2001; see
Chapter 2) is right that exhibiting literature is far more difficult and is only interesting for an
expert audience.
My research stresses the combination of design factors/exhibit characteristics and personal
characteristics of visitors affording particular movement patterns. Thus, as mentioned above, I
largely follow the interaction approach represented by Bitgood (2006) and Rounds (2004)
although not completely. Their formula for as determining the value of the exhibition visits by
dividing benefits by costs seems too simple to exhaustively explain the phenomena
encountered in exhibitions. The “saving steps” principle largely explains the behaviour of
visitors; for example visitors do not backtrack very often. Consequently, they also do not even
250

look back very often. Remember the few backward gazes that were performed. However the
“saving steps” principle does not completely explain visitor behaviour. For example “Turns”
while strolling is a frequently performed movement pattern that does not save steps.
Nevertheless, as can be concluded by Rounds (2004: 401), it has become evident that
movement patterns concerned with orientation and strolling serve as an “initial scanning
mechanism” in selecting exhibits for a more detailed appropriation by movement patterns that
are concerned with exhibits themselves. I did not test Rounds rules in detail because this
would have needed the analysis of the complete circulation through an exhibition and some of
Rounds theoretical rules are hardly workable as previously mentioned.

8.2.2. The Influence of Digital Guides
Digital guides influence the viewing behaviour. In general, usage of digital guides like
handheld audio guides and multimedia tablet-like guides shares two characteristics. Firstly,
the usage of digital guides rather than the level of expertise lead to a prolonged dwell time in
the exhibition. This finding is in line with Tallon (2006) and Eghbal-Azar et al. (2016) who
provide quantitative evidence about the prolonged dwell time in the “nexus” exhibition, if
visitors use the digital guide M3.
Secondly, usage of handheld digital guides leads to a more active viewing behaviour in the
sense that a lot more and a broader range of different kinds of movement patterns are
performed. This contradicts the empirically unproven prejudices summarized by Tallon &
Walker (2008) about handheld digital guide leading to a passive zombie-like consumption.
In contrast, providing no additional information (neither text panels nor digital guide) leads
only to a shallow processing of the display. Although text panel reading also leads to a more
elaborate processing, digital guide usage usually leads to a complete consumption of
information (cf. Smith & Tinio 2008) in contrast to a partial consumption of text panels. This
can inspire longer dwell times and a more elaborate processing with digital guides.
Furthermore, additional evidence is supplied about the parallel way of appropriating and
experiencing exhibitions by listening to the audio guide and viewing the exhibits at the same
time. This finding agrees with findings by Smith & Tinio (2008) and Bitgood (2010). Audio
guide usage broadens the embodiment of the exhibition by merging of the visual and auditory
sense while being in bodily action. Likewise audio guide usage broadens the museum
251

experience and especially leads to a more elaborate learning and multisensory experience.
Thus viewing behaviour with audio guide usage becomes more elaborate and complex, and is
guided by the information provided by the audio guide. This conclusion contradicts Franklin
et al. (1993) who found that titles do not influence the viewing behaviour at exhibits.
However unlike this thesis they did not focus on digital media.
Moreover, digital guides lead to an extended appropriation as further distinct movement
patterns are performed. Due to the embodiment of the M3 as an “electronic secondary
literature” device in visiting the “nexus” exhibition, the museum experience is broadened by
the haptic sense of touch the M3 that allows visitors to ‘touch’ the exhibits indirectly and
virtually. Thus, the usage of the M3 leads to a more exhaustive experience of “nexus” and to
more haptic/emotional moments. In contrast to audio guide usage, multimedia guides without
available audio guide function again separate gaze and attention between exhibit and
information level like a text panel. Nevertheless, multimedia guides better incorporate the
information level with the display level due to their closeness to the particular exhibit that is
provided by their mobility.
The MET studies in both exhibitions provide examples of particular viewing behaviour and
the cognitive processes that go along with the use of digital guides and thus provide insights
about this last step in the selection process of exhibits. The MET study in the “nexus”
exhibition as well as Eghbal-Azar et al. (2016) found that position and popularity of author
names play an important role in this selection process. Furthermore the MET study finds
another reason for exhibit selection in the M3: cognitive dissonance between an exhibit and
its label lead to an increased interest in further information in the multimedia guide.

8.2.3. Summary
As it has become evident, all three key terms are interconnected with each other. Particular
affordances lead to particular appropriations by particular movement patterns, which in turn
lead to a particular experience. These three phenomena are interconnected with each other.
Thereby the digital guide usage influences this interconnection. Usage of digital guides
creates more affordances and shifts the perception of affordances in exhibitions. Parallel or
successive and extended appropriation leads to an extended and more elaborate experience by
extending the visual sense to the auditory and haptic senses. Performing particular movement
252

patterns largely shapes the museum experience. Performing more and a broader range of
different movement patterns leads to a more elaborate processing and hence deeper
experience of the exhibition. This validates previous research about digital guides in
exhibitions (cf. Belotti et al. 2002; Helal et al. 2013; Kuflik et al., 2011; Mann & Tung, 2015;
Webb & Mann, 2014, Viehöver 2006; see Chapter 1) and extends it by identifying particular
movement patterns that are involved in this process.
The appropriation and experience of an exhibition seem to be largely dependent on the level
of expertise that correlates with the visitor’s agenda when visiting an exhibition. The
affordances of the two field settings – the “nexus” exhibition at the LiMo and the “South Sea
Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in
Stuttgart – are the same but different. They are the same insofar as most of the movement
patterns could be identified in both exhibitions. However, they are different insofar as further
movement patterns were identified in the “nexus” exhibition. Furthermore, the appropriation
of “nexus” by performing particular movement patterns is characterized by the affordances of
an almost homogenous presentation of multi-partitioned exhibits that have to be examined
from a short distance and by the provided digital guide M3 with its integral information
function. M3 usage leads to more distinct movement patterns or more variability of movement
patterns as far as there are more forms of “Alternating Gazes” and more forms of “Reading
Gazes” in this exhibition. In general the appropriation of the “nexus” exhibition is
characterized by a lot more “Window Shopping” and “Minor Orientation Gazes” as scanning
strategies from close distances.
In contrast, the appropriation of the “South Sea Oases: Life and Survival in the Western
Pacific” is characterized by a broader range of design that also includes freestanding exhibits,
and both homogenous and heterogeneous display cabinets. Hence the viewing behaviour is
more balanced than in “nexus”.
The concept of affordance by Gibson (1979) is a useful theory to study the movement patterns
of museum visitors and should be complemented with Norman’s (2013) idea of signifiers in
the design suggestions that follow.

253

8.3. Design Suggestions
Based on my research results I want to provide general and specific design suggestions
regarding the particular affordances in exhibitions and the particular affordances of the digital
guides for exhibition makers. Note that each design feature has its trade-offs. These design
suggestions are crafted to promote visitor-centred design in museum exhibitions. Furthermore
the design suggestions may seem familiar to exhibition makers, but so far a comprehensive
system of design suggestions related to empirical evidence of particular movement patterns
and based on the theory of affordances was missing. Thus exhibition makers can gain
empirically based insights to make an informed decision about the design option they choose.

8.3.1. General Design Suggestions
The empirically supported general design suggestions include recommendations for
orientating your visitors, presenting your exhibition, providing digital guides, focusing on
your target audience and training your staff as mentioned already above.

•

Orientation

First visitors seek orientation. Orientation plays a crucial role in visiting exhibitions as could
be correctly concluded by the interaction approach of Bitgood (2006) and Rounds (2004).
Thus you can provide clear initial information (visible titling, theme, intentions of the
exhibition) at the entrance. You can provide signs or signifiers for orientation, and you can
put all this information and important exhibits on eye-level or risk that they will not be
attended.

•

Presentation Practice

Think carefully whether you display exhibits freestanding, in homogenous or heterogeneous
display cabinets. If you use display cabinets, consider carefully whether you want the visitors
to view it only from the front side or from other sides as well. There are differences in
appropriating the exhibits according to these display options.
The good news is display cabinets work well. Display cabinets work even better compared to
freestanding exhibits and even better though the display cabinets showcase a heterogeneous
254

range of exhibits. This is probably because putting exhibits behind glass suggests more value
and ads an aura to the exhibits (Thiemeyer submitted). However this thesis is concerned with
affordances, thus another explanation as mentioned already above might also be valid.
Think of display cabinets as limiting the affordances for interaction or even preventing it, as
can be concluded by Norman’s definition that glass walls constitute an “anti-affordance”
(2013: 11). Of course, visitors do not walk through display cabinets. Thus probably display
cabinets not only provide security for the exhibits but also for the visitors. Visitors probably
feel more comfortable with well-known display cabinets and thus perform more and a broader
range of possible movement patterns than at freestanding exhibits. More research about this
presumed explanation must be conducted.
Secondly, homogenous presentation was identified as one possible reason behind “museum
fatigue” (Davey 2005).
Thirdly, too many levels of glassy shelves within display cabinets, may lead to confusion but
also to more action possibilities. For example “Changing Perspective” may also be performed
to see the bottom side of the cabinets or “Alternating Gazes” around the corner of a display
cabinet or “Pull Backs” through the glass shelves and walls or “Zooming Closers” from
distantly shelves to lower or higher glass shelves.
Finally yet importantly, whether the exhibits are freestanding or within a display cabinet, you
should place items that do not belong together apart from each other. Otherwise visitors
become confused. The reverse is also true: place items together that belong together.

•

Digital Guides

If you want your visitors to stay in your exhibition longer and view and process it more
elaborately, then provide a digital guide. However consider carefully which guide you want to
provide and how it shall work in your exhibition and how it can be handled. Though you want
them to appropriate and process the exhibits in a parallel way, choose an audio guide. Audio
guides allow listening and appropriating the exhibition at the same time in a parallel way and
cognitive processing. Though you want to divide the experience between the display level and
information level put all additional information into your multimedia guide. This could be
advantageous if you display textual exhibits. Keep your digital guide light in its weight and
handling. Easy handling could be accomplished by automatic self-localization of the digital
255

guide or by help information that is automatically given by the digital guide right at the start
of the visit or by self-explanatory guidance. In the end, keep your digital guides updated
technically and substantially.

•

Target Audience

Keep your target audience in mind when you create and design your exhibition. If you want
sophisticated expert visitors as your target audience, be brave and admit it. If you want to take
care of your novice visitors display a heterogeneous range of exhibits.

•

Staff

Train your staff deliberately and in standardized ways. Especially train your museums
attendants to take care of the exhibits and museum visitors unobtrusively. Additionally do not
muzzle your museum attendants, in contrast train them to provide standardized introductory
information about the exhibition and the digital guides.

8.3.2. Specific Design Suggestions – a Selection
Moving from these general design suggestions, this section summarizes the more specific
design suggestions that are connected to a selection of particular eye movement patterns and
their affordances as already mentioned above:

•

Window Shopping/Wandering Along

“Window Shopping” and “Wandering Along” as a scanning mechanism is necessary for the
selection process. If you do not want your visitors “Window Shopping” too much although
you want to use display cabinets, then make the display cabinets as short as possible. Be
aware that you are not safe from disengagement, if you just do not put the exhibits in display
cabinets but present them freestanding. “Wandering Along” at freestanding exhibits is a
similar phenomenon to “Window Shopping” at display cabinets. Short and changing inputs
seem to be the solution that works against active snoozing and museum fatigue.
256

•

Insight:

If you want your visitors to look inside an exhibit, present it freestanding with an opening.

•

Alternating Gaze:

If you want your visitors to compare exhibits with each other or exhibits with information, put
these items close together.

•

Changing Perspective:

If you want your visitors to look at the exhibit from different perspectives, present it hanging,
no matter whether you put it in a display cabinet or not. As mentioned above, the “Changing
Perspective” movement pattern highlights one of the most important and distinguishing
features encountered in exhibitions: the ability to explore in multiple possible ways and from
a number of perspectives. This is the main attraction of museums as mass media compared to
other mass media like TV and Computers. And this is what provides unique museum
experiences.

8.4. Projections
In the end, I want to project firstly, the future of digital guides in museum exhibitions;
secondly the future of MET in visitor studies and socio-cultural anthropology; thirdly the
future of the new cognitive science approach in visitor studies; and fourthly the future visitor
studies.

8.4.1. The Future of Digital Guides in Museum Exhibitions
In the future, more digital guides and apps for smartphones will prospectively be applied in
exhibitions. This research recommends this development. Digital guides were shown to be not
as negative as portrayed, in contrast they lead to a prolonged dwell time, more and broader
ranges of movement patterns, thus a more active viewing behaviours and a more elaborate
cognitive processing. Digital guides do not hinder viewing and experiencing exhibits, they
introduce a different way of parallel or successive and extended appropriation.
257

8.4.2. The Future of Mobile Eye Tracking in Visitor Studies and Socio-Cultural
Anthropology
In the future, MET will probably be more frequently applied as a complementary method in
visitor studies and socio-cultural anthropology. We demonstrated that applying MET as a
recent method in visitor studies provided totally new insights into visitors’ unconscious
movement patterns at exhibits and smaller exhibition sections that was lacking so far and
would not be accomplished by purely applying observation with paper-and-pencil. Thus the
critical reflection of the applied methods in Chapter 7 prompts that MET can be advantageous
for visitor and socio-cultural anthropologists who conduct fieldwork. MET is a productive
method in fieldwork that aims to elicit unconscious movement behaviour in natural settings.
With MET we can “grasp the native’s point of view” (Malinowksi 1922: 25) in its literal
sense. Hence, I follow the main aim of anthropological research. Thereby MET will not
replace established methods in visitor studies and socio-cultural anthropology but can
complement established methods to achieve deeper insights into the appropriation of the
world by the visual sense, like this research accomplished.

8.4.3. The Future of the New Cognitive Science Approach in Visitor Studies
In the future, the new cognitive science approach that combines theories and methods from
psychology and anthropology will probably catch on in visitor studies because visitor studies
are already carried out by different disciplines of the so-called museum studies. Although this
new approach needs interdisciplinary knowledge and sensitivity, it is worth pursuing. Its use
revealed new concepts including the appropriation of exhibitions by performing particular
movement patterns, a fruitful application of the psychological term “affordance” by Gibson
(1979) and first empirical evidence for Rounds (2004: 401) rules. Furthermore, it leads to new
knowledge about visitors’ viewing behaviour and their particular agenda (taking part in an
MET study for example). Following this approach, with its anthropological aim of studying
the underprivileged museum visitors and seeking their emic point of view can have a great
impact on creating visitor-centred exhibitions.

8.4.4. Future Visitor Studies
Future visitor research should focus on the occurrence of the 26 distinct, recurrent and
systematic movement patterns in natural tasks outside of museum exhibitions. In contrast to
other tasks in natural behaviour, viewing exhibitions requires less eye-hand-coordination.
Therefore exhibition visits seem to be some kind of artificial behaviour; whereas the main
sense that appropriates the exhibition is vision, or rather exhibitions are touched by the
particular movement patterns. Thus future research should focus on the comparability of these
two different types of behaviour and hence the transferability of my results to other
behavioural possibilities in the three-dimensional space. It can be presumed that the
movement patterns found in exhibitions form a subset of movement patterns in everyday life
(Eghbal-Azar & Widlok 2013).
Finally yet importantly, Chua, Boland & Nisbett (2005; see Chapter 4) found first empirical
evidence based on eye tracking that there are cultural differences in scene perception.
Thinking of Benedict’s cultural relativism in Patterns of Culture (1934/2005) or Bourdieu’s
(1969/1997) conclusion of museum visits as learned cultural patterns and his ‘habitus’
concept (Bourdieu 1977) the culture-cognition connection in attention processes is more than
reasonable for socio-cultural anthropologists. Studying the previous results in visitor studies
cross-culturally should be the general goal of visitor researchers because most of their
research examines so-called WEIRD people (i.e., western, educated, industrial, rich and
democratic) of so-called “Western” societies (Heinrich, Heine & Norenzayan 2010). Even
psychologists are aware of the biases studying this population can impose. The psychologists
Heinrich, Heine & Norenzayan (2010) found that research about these WEIRD people cannot
be generalized to all human beings on this planet. Thus being a socio-cultural anthropologist,
I want to finally conclude that future visitor research must study the 26 distinct, recurrent and
systematic movement patterns found in German museums with German-speaking visitors
cross-culturally.

Introduction

Audio Guide German Version:
800 – Karte (2:35 min., Frauenstimme, keine Musik)
Herzlich willkommen in der Ausstellung „Südsee-Oasen: Leben und Überleben im Westpazifik“!
Die vielen kleinen Inseln im westlichen Pazifik, die Sie hier auf der Karte sehen und die gemeinsam als „Mikronesien“
bezeichnet werden, liegen für uns sehr weit weg – im wörtlichen wie im übertragenen Sinne. Im blau-türkis-changierenden
Meer gelegen, sind sie zwar betörend schön, doch besitzen sie weder Bodenschätze noch sonstiges Potential, auf das sich die
internationale Aufmerksamkeit richten könnte. Erst durch den Klimawandel sind sie derzeit im Fokus – und es ist eine
tragische Tatsache, dass in den nächsten 20, 30 Jahren viele von ihnen nicht mehr bewohnbar sein könnten.
Auch in der Vergangenheit waren vor allem die Atoll-Inseln, die nur wenige Meter über dem Meeresspiegel liegen, immer
wieder von Stürmen und Flutwellen bedroht. Um diese Gefahren zu überstehen, entwickelten die Menschen verschiedenste
Strategien, von denen wir in der Ausstellung berichten wollen. Eine Strategie beruhte auf der genauen Beobachtung der
Naturphänomene zu Land und Meer und der genauen Kenntnis der Gestirne. Aber auch die spirituelle Ebene der Geister und
Schutzgötter spielte eine wichtige Rolle.
Werfen wir nun einen genaueren Blick auf die Karte. Mikronesien erstreckt sich über eine riesige Entfernung von 4000
Kilometern. Ganz im Osten liegen die Inseln der Republik Kiribati (sprich Kiribas). Weiter westwärts folgen die MarshallInseln, die sich in zwei Ketten von Süd nach Nord erstrecken – und die ebenso wie die Kiribati-Inseln fast nur aus Atollen
bestehen. Nach Westen schließen sich die hohen Inseln Kosrae (sprich Koschrae), Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap und Palau an,
zwischen denen sich die große Zahl der karolinischen Atoll-Inseln ausdehnt. Die Kulturen dieser weit gestreuten Inseln sind
einander relativ ähnlich – was für eine beispiellose Vernetzung der Menschen untereinander seit Jahrtausenden spricht.
Lassen Sie uns nun tiefer in die Kulturen Mikronesiens eintauchen.
Zu zahlreichen Exponaten hält der Audioguide Erläuterungen für Sie bereit – geben Sie bitte die entsprechende Nummer ein

Section 1: The Men’s House Model from Palau

Audio Guide German Version:
806 – Palau-Haus (1:33 min., Männerstimme, keine Musik)
Die geschnitzten und bemalten Balken der Männerhausgiebel von Palau gehören zu den außergewöhnlichen Kunstwerken
Mikronesiens. Sie zeigen Mythen, historische Szenen und Fabeln, die immer eine Lehre beinhalten. Neben ihrer
vordergründigen Moral verbergen sie häufig noch tiefere Bedeutungsebenen. Nicht nur die bemalten Fassaden, auch die
kompakten Männerhäuser sind mit ihren hochgezogenen Dächern von bemerkenswerter ästhetischer Ausstrahlung. Die
Häuser wurden von hoch angesehenen Baumeistern errichtet, und zwar ohne einen einzigen Nagel, nur mit Nuten und
Zapfen. Die vier stabilen Außenpfosten stehen für die ersten vier Häuptlinge einer Gemeinde und symbolisieren gleichzeitig
die vier „Gründungsdörfer“ der palauischen Überlieferung.
Wenn Sie die einzelnen Szenen der Bemalungen betrachten, werden Sie feststellen, dass ein immer wieder kehrendes Motiv
das Ausleger-Kanu ist. Auf den Palau-Inseln konnte ein solches Kanu sogar identitätsstiftend für ein ganzes Dorf sein.
Einen prominenten Platz nimmt auf unserem Haus der Hahn ein, der indirekt für das Sonnenlicht verantwortlich war, das die
„Zeit der Götter“ beendete. Auf dem Giebel findet sich dagegen eine Geschichte, die sich um den Kampf zwischen
Taroknollen und Rochen rankt.
Das nach dem gleichen Prinzip konstruierte Haus daneben ist ein originales „Götterhäuschen“, in dem die Ahnen einer
Familie vom Familienvorstand geehrt wurden.

807 – 2. Haus und Spreizfigur (1:51 min., Frauenstimme, keine Musik)
„Dilukai“ heißen die Frauenskulpturen, die mit geradezu akrobatisch auseinander gespreizten Beinen eine recht
ungewöhnliche Haltung einnehmen. Sie stammen ebenfalls von Palau, und schmückten dort früher die Giebel

der

Häuptlings- und Klubhäuser. Der Name Dilukai bezeichnet eine Frau, um die sich verschiedene Legenden ranken.
Da die Position der Figuren von palauischen Männern als beschämend empfunden wird, hieß es in den mündlichen
Traditionen lange, dass damit „Prostituierte“ dargestellt seien, die auf Zeit die Männer eines anderen Dorfes unterhielten.
Nach einer anderen Legende war Dilukai eine Frau, die durch ihre Freizügigkeit ihren Brüdern die Schamesröte ins Gesicht
trieb.
Eine modernere Deutung ist, dass die Skulpturen das weibliche Grundprinzip in dieser mutterrechtlichen Gesellschaft
verkörpern. Zwar werden sie nackt gezeigt,

doch sind sie mit Armbändern und Geldschmuck, also mit den Insignien einer

„großen Frau“ ausgestattet.
Lässt man die geschlechtliche Komponente der Skulpturen außer Acht, zeigen sie auf einer abstrahierten Ebene auch
Anklänge an die Bootsformen Indonesiens, die dort die Basis eines Dorfes verkörpern. Ein indonesischer oder philippinischer
Einfluss klingt auch in der Gestaltung von Gesicht und Frisur an. Er ist ebenfalls erkennbar an den kleinen Figuren, die die
Griffe der Schöpfkellen zieren.
Bemerkenswert ist, dass in ganz Mikronesien kaum Skulpturen zu finden sind – nur auf den Inseln Palau und Yap und auf
Nukuoro hat sich die plastische Kunst zu einem beachtlichen Grad entwickelt.

275

Audio Guide English Version:
806 – Palau House (German version: 1:33 min., male voice, no music)
The carved and pointed beams of the gables on the men’s meeting-house in Palau are among the most remarkable artworks in
Micronesia. They show myths, historical scenes and fables that always carry some lesson. Apart from their obvious moral,
they often had a deeper level of meaning. Not only the painted facades, but the compact men’s houses themselves, with their
high roofs, had a remarkable aesthetic vibrancy. They were built by highly respected architects without a single nail –
exclusively with mortise-and-tenon joins. The four stable cornerposts stand for the first four chieftains of the community, and
also symbolize the four predominant villages of the Palau founding myths.
If you examine the individual scenes on the paintings you see that a motif that occurs over and over again is the outrigger
canoe. In Palau such a canoe could represent the identity of an entire village.
A prominent place on our house is occupied by the rooster, which is responsible for the sunlight that ends the “time of the
gods” – or night. On the gable is a story about the battle between taro roots and rays.
The small house next to it is an original sacred house – in which ancestors were venerated by the head of the family.

807 – Second House and Splayed Figure (German Version: 1:50 min., female voice, no music)
Dilukai is the name given to figures of women with acrobatically spread legs. Such carvings come from Palau where they
decorated the gable above the entrance to the chieftains’ house and men’s club houses. The name Dilukai denotes a woman
about whom there are various legends.
The posture of the figures is considered embarrassing to Palauan men and for a long time oral tradition identified them as
prostitutes who serviced the men of another village. According to a different legend, Dilukai was a woman whose
promiscuous behaviour made her brothers blush for shame.
A more modern interpretation is that the sculptures represent the feminine principle in this matrilineal society. While they are
represented naked, they are adorned with bracelets and valuables, the insignias of important or high-status women.
Apart from the sexual components of the sculptures, at an abstract level they are also reminiscent of the boat shapes of
Indonesia which there, too, are the basis of a village community. Indonesian or Philippine influences can also be seen in the
design of the face and hairstyle. The same is true of the small figures that decorate oil lamps. Sculpture is rarely found
throughout Micronesia, and it is remarkable that on Palau and Yap and the outlying atoll of Nukuoro carving was such a
highly developed art.

Section 2: The Original Outrigger Fishing Canoe from Yap

Text Panel German Version:
Auf See
Auf den großen hochseetüchtigen Booten konnten bis zu zwanzig Personen reisen, auf einem Auslegerkanu wie dem hier
gezeigten sind es je nach Witterung fünf bis acht. Als Höchstgeschwindigkeit der größeren Reiseboote werden 12 Knoten
geschätzt, die „normale“ Reisegeschwindigkeit liegt allerdings bei 6 bis 8 Knoten und niedriger, wenn z.B. das Segel nass
wird.
Vor dem Aufbruch wird der Mast begleitet von Zeremonien aufgestellt. Durch einen Gesang und ein leichtes Schlagen beim
Einsetzen wird erreicht, dass er „leicht“ wird und das Boot nicht seinen Weg verliert.
Die Boote sind so konstruiert, dass beim Kreuzen gegen den Wind nicht gehalst wird, sondern man das Segel vom Bug zum
Heck versetzt, so dass der Ausleger immer dem Wind zugewandt bleibt. Bei großen Booten sitzt der Navigator auf einer dem
Ausleger gegenüberliegenden Plattform, von wo er alles „im Blick“ hat und mit der Segelleine das Segel kontrollieren kann.
Im Heck sitzt der Steuermann mit einem mobilen Steuerruder, der mit dem Navigator zusammenarbeitet und dafür sorgt, dass
das Boot trotz Einwirkung des Auslegers auf Kurs bleibt. Für das Umsetzen des Segels bei hohem Seegang wurden früher bis
zu vier Männer benötigt, mit den heute benutzten modernen Segeltüchern ist das Umsetzen auch von zwei Leuten zu
bewältigen.
Ebenso unverzichtbar wie Navigator und Steuermann sind diejenigen, die das durch hohe See hineingeschwappte oder durch
die Nahtstellen eingedrungene Wasser aus dem Boot schöpfen. Obwohl das Reisen auf mikronesischen Auslegerkanus keine
bequeme Angelegenheit ist, fühlen sich die Männer auf dem Meer ausgesprochen wohl – es ist von klein auf ein Teil ihrer
Lebenswelt.

Text Panel Translated English Version:
At Sea
Up to 20 people could sail on the large sea-faring boats; on an outrigger canoe, like the one shown here, five to eight,
depending on the weather. It is estimated that the speed of the larger boats can reach 12 knots, with the normal cruising speed
between six and eight knots, and less when, for example, the sail is wet.
Before setting sail a ceremony accompanies the putting up of the mast. This involves singing and a low drumming to ensure
it is “light” and the boat does not lose its way.
The boats are so constructed that while cruising against the wind the boat will not jibe; instead the sail is placed from bow to
stern so that the outrigger is always facing the wind. On larger boats the navigator sits on a board opposite the outrigger
where he has everything in view and from where he can control the sail with the sail rope. The helmsman sits at the stern
with a mobile rudder which he uses, together with the navigator, to ensure that the boat stays on course despite outrigger’s
movements.
Up to four men were needed to hoist the sails on the high seas. With today’s modern sails it is possible with only two people.
Equally as indispensable as the navigator and helmsman are those that empty the water that has collected in the boat from
waves on the high seas or from penetrating the seams of the boat. Although far from being comfortable on their Micronesian
outrigger canoes the men do feel remarkably at ease at sea – from a young age it is part of their way of life.

Audio Guide German Version:
821 Das Auslegerkanu im Linden-Museum (2:18 min., Männerstimme, keine Musik)
Das Auslegerkanu ist das bestimmende Gefährt der Südsee und ist deshalb in seiner Bedeutung weit mehr als nur ein Boot.
Wir freuen uns sehr, Ihnen dieses Auslegerkanu im Linden-Museum präsentieren zu dürfen. Der Häuptling und
Bootsbaumeister Bruno Tharngan, der selbst von der Insel Yap stammt, hat es vor über 20 Jahren als sein erstes großes Boot
gebaut und im Vorfeld unserer Ausstellung nach Stuttgart überführt. Für den Transport wurde das Boot von seinem Ausleger
getrennt, außerdem wurden Bug und Heck entfernt. Hier im Museum setzten Bruno Tharngan und der Navigator Ali
Haleyáur mit ihren zwei Gehilfen Alfred und Niklas das Kanu wieder zusammen, dichteten es ab und versetzten es in
segeltüchtigen Zustand, sodass sich unsere Besucher ein genaues Bild dieses hochseetauglichen Bootes machen können, das
vor allem zum Fischen eingesetzt wurde.
Bei den Auslegerkanus in Mikronesien stehen Effizienz, Schnelligkeit und Sicherheit im Vordergrund – besonderen Komfort
erwarten die Segler dagegen nicht. Der aus mehreren Teilen bestehende Bootskörper wird mit Kokosschnüren
zusammengehalten, die für eine gewisse Flexibilität sorgen. Der Ausleger, ebenfalls fest mit dem Boot verbunden, sorgt für
Stabilität. Oft sind die Bootskörper leicht asymmetrisch konstruiert, um die Zugwirkung des Auslegers auszugleichen. Beim
Kreuzen gegen den Wind wird das Segel mitsamt dem Segelbaum vom Bug zum Heck versetzt.
Während der Kolonialzeit wurde das früher unverzichtbare Wissen um Bootsbau und Navigation unterdrückt, und später
wurden traditionelle Boote fast überall von europäischen Konstruktionen und Außenbordmotoren verdrängt. Nur auf den
kleinen Außeninseln konnte sich die alte maritime Tradition buchstäblich über Wasser halten. Es ist deshalb eine erfreuliche
Entwicklung, dass der traditionelle Bootsbau und die Sternennavigation seit etwa 20 Jahren eine beachtliche Renaissance
erleben. So werden heute Boote wie das hier Ausgestellte wieder für den Fischfang außerhalb des Riffs und für kürzere
Hochseefahrten eingesetzt. Und die Vorbildfunktion für moderne Tri- und Katamarane ist ebenfalls nicht zu übersehen.

Audio Guide English Version:
821 The Linden-Museum’s Outrigger Canoe (German version: 2:18 min., male voice, no music)
The outrigger canoe is THE determining craft of the South Seas – and its significance goes beyond that of a mere boat. We
are happy to be able to present the Linden Museum’s outrigger canoe. Over 20 years ago it was the first big canoe made by
Bruno Tharngan, a chief and master-boat-builder from Yap Island, and he brought it to Stuttgart ahead of our exhibition. The
boat was separated from the outrigger for transport, and the bow and stern were removed. Here in the museum, Bruno
Tharngan, together with navigator Ali Haleyalur and two assistants, Alfred and Niklas, reassembled the canoe. They caulked
it, and made it seaworthy in order to give our visitors an exact impression of this ocean-going boat which is mainly used for
fishing.
Micronesian outrigger canoes had to be efficient, fast and safe – sailors did not expect them to offer any great comforts or to
hold provisions for more than a week or two. The body of the boat is made of several parts lashed together with sennit rope,
which allows for a certain amount of flexibility. The outrigger, which is also tied to the boat, serves to stabilize it. The boat
hulls are often longitudinally asymmetrical to compensate for the drag of the outrigger. When the boat crosses before the
wind, the entire sail and mast are moved from the bow to the stern.
During the colonial period, the old boat-building and navigation skills were repressed. Later the traditional boats were almost
completely replaced by western-style boats and outboard motors. Only the small Outer Islands managed to keep the old
maritime traditions – literally – afloat. Happily, over the past two decades there has been a Renaissance of traditional boatbuilding and navigation methods in the region. Canoes like the one on display here are once again being produced for fishing
outside the reef and for short ocean voyages. And the influence of these craft on modern catamarans and trimarans is plain to
see.

Section 3: The Homogenous Display Cabinet

Text Panel German Version:
Die Kunst des Webens
Die Faserweberei wurde vermutlich aus dem asiatischen Raum eingeführt und ist bis Kosrae im Westen verbreitet. Dort
finden sich in den traditionellen Durchziehschurzen tol die feinsten Muster. Die Kette wird mit Hilfe von Kettbock und
Schergitter auf das geplante Muster vorbereitet, wobei die unterschiedlich gefärbten Fäden mit feinsten Knoten
aneinandergereiht werden.
Verwendet wird fein gesplissener Bananenbast, der sehr haltbar ist, und Hibiskusbast, der nach der Herstellung eher porös ist,
aber Farben sehr gut annimmt. Aus den gleichen Materialien wurden auf Pohnpei Gürtel gefertigt, die, mit feinsten Mustern
und zusätzlichem Muschelzierrat versehen, nur dem Adel vorbehalten waren.
Auf den Außeninseln wird bis heute gewebt, hauptsächlich mit modernen Garnen und einer entsprechenden Farbvielfalt. Neu
erlernt wurde in den letzten Jahren die Kunst der machi-Herstellung. Diese Tücher wurden auf den Außeninseln Fais und
Ulithi bei rituellen Anlässen – der Initiation der Jungen, der Einsetzung eines Häuptlings und bei Beerdigungen – genutzt und
zeichnen sich durch feinste Musterflächen aus. In ähnlicher Technik wurden auf den Westlichen Außeninseln traditionell
Durchziehschurze für die Männer und breitere Kleidertücher gearbeitet, die heute der Vergangenheit angehören.
Vor allem über die diffizile Webtradition auf Kosrae ist wenig bekannt. Hier wirkte die Bevölkerungsdezimierung und die
Kleidervorstellungen der Mission Mitte des 19. Jh. zusammen, die tol als Kleidung zu ersetzen.

Text Panel Translated English Version:
The Art of Weaving
Fabric weaving was probably introduced from Asia and spread across to Kosrae in the west. Here the most elaborate designs
are to be found in the traditional tol loincloths. The warp is prepared for the intended pattern using a weaver’s beam and a
warping grid where the different coloured threads are joined together with very small knots.
Fine strands of banana bast fibres, which are very durable, are used as well as hibiscus bast fibres which become porous after
processing but absorb dyes well. On Pohnpei belts were made from the same material, with elaborate patterns and further
decorated with shells reserved only for the high chiefs.
On the outer islands weaving is still done today, mostly with modern wool and a wide selection of colours. In recent years the
art of machi making has been learnt. These fabrics, characterised by their exquisite patterns, were used on the outer islands
Fais and Ulithi in ritual practices such as boys’ initiation, appointment of a chief and at funerals. Using a similar technique
men’s loincloths and larger wraparounds (worn in the past) were traditionally made on the Western Outer Islands.
Little is known especially about the difficult weaving tradition on Kosrae. The decrease in population together with dress
codes of the missionary replaced the tol as clothing in the mid-19th century.

811 Faserweberei (1:56 min., Frauenstimme, keine Musik)
Die fein gearbeiteten Webstücke, die sie in dieser Vitrine bewundern können, sind im ozeanischen Raum eine Besonderheit
der mikronesischen Kulturen. Ursprünglich stammt dieses Kunsthandwerk aus Asien. Es ist faszinierend zu sehen, wie aus
feinsten Naturfasern mit einem einfachen Webstuhl solch filigrane Muster entstehen. Die Grundlage der Gewebe sind
Bananenfasern, die äußerst fein gespalten werden können, Hibiskusfasern hingegen sorgen für die Musterungen. Letztere
werden porös, wenn man sie mit Meerwasser benetzt, und lassen sich dadurch gut färben.
Auf der Insel Kosrae wurden die Gewebe als Durchzieh- oder Wickelschurze getragen – und zu Beginn der Missionierung
durch so genannte Missionskleider ersetzt. Eine Vitrine weiter sehen Sie besonders gemusterte Gewebe, die dem Adel
vorbehalten waren und äußerst delikat verziert sind. Die Durchziehschurze in der Vitrine rechts, die an den Enden mit feinen
Musterstreifen versehen sind, waren traditionell den Männern vorbehalten, während die Matten der Frauen mit breiten
Streifen gemustert sind.
Neben dem alltäglichen Gebrauch der Gewebe wurden sie auch für rituelle Zwecke genutzt, beispielsweise auf der Insel Fais.
Mit den so genannten „machi“-Tüchern (gesprochen Matchi) wurden dort die Toten bestattet, die Einsetzung eines
Häuptlings fand „unter einem machi“ statt - Aufnahmen zeigen sie vor dem Haus eines Magiers - und bei Tributzahlungen
konnte man für ein machi besondere Gegenleistungen verlangen. Im Gegensatz zu unserer an Gegenständen

so

überfrachteten Gesellschaft konnte in Mikronesien ein Objekt mehrere Funktionen zwischen profanem Alltag und spiritueller
Welt erfüllen.

Audio Guide English Version:

811 Fiber Weaving (German version: 1:56 min., female voice, no music)
The finely worked woven cloths you can admire in the display case are a specialty of Micronesian culture. Originally this
handicraft came from Asia. It is fascinating to see how, with the help of a simple loom, thin natural fibers are turned into such
delicate designs. The basis of the weave is banana fiber, which can be finely split into threads. Hibiscus fiber is used for the
patterns. It becomes porous when it is wet with seawater and can be easily dyed. In Kosrae, the fabrics were worn as apronlike or wrap-around skirts, but when European missionaries first came, they were replaced by “mission apparel.” In the next
display case you see the specially patterned cloth reserved for the nobility, which is very finely decorated. The draw-string
apron to the right, decorated with a finely striped pattern at the ends was traditionally reserved for men, while the mats worn
by the women were patterned with broad stripes.
Apart from everyday use, the fabrics were also used for ritual purposes, for instance on Fais Island. There the cloth known as
“machi” [PRONOUNCED: matchi] was used for funerals; the installation ceremony of a chief took place “under a machi”
and the machi was considered the most valuable item of tribute. In contrast to our so object-filled society, in Micronesia one
object could fulfil numerous functions in both everyday life and the spiritual world.

Palau, wo Geld schmückt
Ob die Geldstücke Palaus – aus Glasfluss und keramischem Material bestehend und abhängig von Größe und Material in
verschiedenste Kategorien und Unterkategorien eingeteilt – letztendlich von philippinischen Schiffen oder aus Indonesien
stammen, wird vielleicht nie zu eruieren sein. In der palauischen Gesellschaft waren und sind sie von großem Wert und bis
heute Teil aller traditionellen Transaktionen. Sie sind aber auch ein besonders geschätzter Schmuck, der zu mehreren Stücken
nebeneinander um den Hals getragen und mit Sicherheit wahrgenommen und kommentiert wird.
Weniger Geld als Anerkennung für geleistete Hilfe ist das schalenförmige Frauengeld „toluk“ aus Schildpatt. Reifen aus dem
gleichen Material, aufeinander liegend zusammengefügt, bilden den Armschmuck großer Frauen, während nur Häuptlinge
den Schmuck aus dem Rückenwirbel der Seekuh tragen durften.
Mit Haarkämmen steckten Männer wie Frauen früher ihre Frisuren am Hinterkopf fest.

Text Panel Translated English Version:
Palau – Money as Decoration
Whether Palau’s coins – made from molten glass and ceramic material, and divided into various categories according to size
and material – originated from Filipino ships or from Indonesia will probably never been known. They have been and still are
very valuable to Palauan society and are still part of all traditional transactions. Worn as a necklace with several pieces next
to each other they make a valuable piece of jewellery – bound to attract attention and be commented on.
Seen more as recognition for their help, rather than as money is the shell-shaped women’s coin “toluk” made from
tortoiseshell. Hoops from the same material joined together form bracelets for the more important women, whereas only
chiefs were allowed to wear the jewellery made from the vertebrae of the sea cow.
The men, as well as the women, used to pin their hair on the back of their heads with hair combs.

Stellen Sie sich vor, der Wert von einzelnen Geldstücken würde sich danach bemessen, welche Person diese vorher besessen
hat. Um das genauer nachzuprüfen, würden „Geldspezialisten“ die jeweilige „Geldgeschichte“ speichern. Eine verwegene,
aber auch faszinierende Idee – auf der Insel Palau gehörte dies zum Alltag. Natürlich galten auch andere
Bemessungsfaktoren, nämlich die Größe und Beschaffenheit der einzelnen Geldstücke. Diese bestanden aus Bruchstücken
von Armbändern, die vermutlich in voreuropäischer Zeit von gestrandeten Schiffen aus nach Palau gelangt waren. Den
Mythen zufolge stammen sie vom „Geldvogel“; der häufig auf den Malereien der Männerhäuser auftaucht.
Traditionelles Geld wird bis heute vor allem dort eingesetzt, wo es um soziale Belange geht: als Brautpreis bei Hochzeiten,
als „Bezahlung“ während der Schwangerschaft für die „Schönheit des Kindes“, für das „Bersten des Bauches“ oder für das
Recht, ein Kind zu adoptieren.
Doch auch die Dienste eines Heilers oder eines Tatauiermeisters wurden geldlich abgegolten - und es wurden von den
Häuptlingen bei Vergehen für unser Verständnis sehr drastische Geldstrafen verhängt.
Status und Macht waren in allen mikronesischen Gesellschaften wichtig. Neben dem Geld waren es die auf Festen gereichten
Speisen, die den Status erhöhten und festigten, wie die Präsentation in der Raummitte verdeutlicht. Auf Palau etwa
revanchierte sich ein Empfänger von Geld durch große Festmähler, an denen die ganze Großfamilie mitarbeitete. Bei
Dorffesten wurden enorme Mengen Taro auf so genannten Tarobänken angerichtet, Melasse aus großen Gefäßen gereicht,
und weitere Speisen bereitgestellt. Bei solchen Festen wurde Essen auch den Göttern geopfert - irdische Genüsse und
spirituelle Sphären waren also stets miteinander verknüpft.

808 – Money, Barter, Valuables, Food Transport (German version: 2:12 min., female voice, no music)
Try to imagine a society in which the value of individual pieces of money is determined by the identity of their previous
owners. And in order to value them more accurately, certain money specialists retain the memory of each individual coin’s
history. It’s a weird, but fascinating idea – and on Palau it was part of everyday life. There were other factors that also
influenced monetary value – such as the size and make-up of the individual pieces of money. They consisted of fragments of
bracelets thought to have arrived in Palau from stranded ships in precolonial times. According to myth, they came from the
“money bird” that is often found in paintings on men’s meeting-houses.
To this day the old money is used in traditional social situations, for example as dowries at weddings, during pregnancy as a
“payment” for the “child’s beauty”, for the “bursting of the belly” or for the right to adopt a child. The services of a healer or
a tattooing master were paid in traditional money and on occasion chieftains would impose drastic money penalties for
certain social infractions.
Status and power were important factors in all Micronesian societies. In addition to money, the food offered at ceremonies
served to raise and strengthen people’s status, as the presentation in the center of this room shows. In Palau, for example,
someone who received money returned the favour with great feasts which the whole extended family helped to prepare. At
village ceremonies enormous quantities of taro was arranged on what were called taro benches, molasses was served from
large vessels and many other dishes were prepared. Food was also offered to the gods at these feasts – an example of the
constant link between earthly pleasures and the spiritual world.

Schmuck der Insel Nauru – von der Anmutung des Schwebens
Die Insel Nauru war die einzige Kultur Mikronesiens, in der Fregattvögel gezähmt und abgerichtet wurden. Gefangen wurden
sie mit Hilfe von Schleudern, die sich um ihre Beine schlangen. Man hielt sie auf besonderen Anständen am Strand, wo sie so
reichlich mit Fisch gefüttert wurden, dass sie immer wieder zurückkehrten.
Nirgends sonst sind ihre Federn so prominent im Schmuckdesign präsent wie auf Nauru: Sie bilden den beweglichen Teil von
Haarbändern, Halsketten und Gürteln, die durch sie eine schwebende Komponente erhalten, die auch dem fragilen
Ohrschmuck eigen ist, der u.a. mit kleinsten Haizähnen und Spondylus-Stückchen gestaltet wurde.
Die sogenannten Familienmatten, die vor allem von Schwangeren getragen worden sein sollen, wurden ebenfalls mit Federn
besetzt. In der geometrischen Musterung der Flechtung kann man Anklänge der Kiribati-Flechtmatten – oder umgekehrt –
erkennen. Zweifellos gab es einen regelmäßigen Austausch zwischen diesen beiden Inselregionen.

Text Panel Translated English Version:
Jewellery of the Nauru Island – Floating Impressions
The island of Nauru was the only culture in Micronesia where frigate birds were tamed and trained. They were caught using
slings which were wrapped round their legs. They were kept special perches on the beach, where they were fed plenty of fish
so that they always came back.
Nowhere is the use of the feathers so prominent in jewellery design than on Nauru: they form the flexible part of the
headbands, necklaces and belts and give the impression of floating, which is also found on delicate earrings, which were
decorated with the smallest sharks’ teeth and pieces of spondylus and other materials.
The so-called family mats which were meant to be worn primarily by pregnant women were also decorated with feathers.
Similarities can be found between the geometric pattern of the weaving and the Kiribati woven mats. Without a doubt the two
islands regularly traded with each other.

Kurkuma, Spondylus und Kokosperlen
Die Inseln von Chuuk waren berühmt für die Qualität ihrer Kurkuma-Paste, die ein wichtiges Handelsgut und Zahlungsmittel
war. Auf den Inseln selbst wurde sie so intensiv wie möglich angewendet: Auf den Körper, aber auch auf Schmuck und
Kleidermatten aufgetragen, trug sie wesentlich zum farbenfrohen Äußeren von Tänzern oder Autoritäten bei. Kombiniert
wurde sie häufig mit Schmuck aus Spondylus-Schalen - ebenfalls ein wichtiges Handelsgut – und mit Gürteln und
Armschmuck aus Kokosperlen.
Ob bestimmte Schmuckformen, wie z.B. die Haarkämme mit Fregattvogel-Federn, bestimmten Tänzen vorbehalten waren, ist
nicht klar. Die Zusammenstellung aus geschmücktem Poncho, Federbesetztem Schmuckkamm und Arm- und Leibschmuck
wurde während der Hamburgischen Südsee-Expedition bei einem Magie-Häuptling dokumentiert.
Ganz ähnlichen Schmuck trug man auf den Chuuk zugeordneten Außeninseln und – zu Beginn des 20. Jh. – auch auf Saipan,
wohin zu Beginn des 19. Jh. eine große Gruppe von der Insel Satawal nach einem Taifun ausgewandert war.

Text Panel Translated English Version:
Turmeric, Spondylus and Coconut Beads
The islands of Chuuk were famous for their high-quality turmeric paste – an important trading commodity and means of
payment. On the islands themselves it was used as extensively as possible: for the body, also applied on jewellery and mats to
the colourful appearance of dancers or authorities. Often it was combined with jewellery made from spondylus shell – an
equally important trading commodity – and with belts and coconut bead bracelets.
Whether certain pieces of jewellery - like, for example the hair combs with frigatebird feathers – were reserved for particular
dances is not clear. The composition of a decorated poncho, a decorative comb with feathers, and arm and body jewellery
was documented during the Hamburg South Sea expedition by a medicine man chief.
Very similar jewellery was worn on the Outer Islands of Chuuk and - at the beginning of the 20th century - also on Saipan, to
where a large number of people from the Satawal Island emigrated at the beginning of the 19th century after a typhoon.

809 – Chuuk, Kurkuma (1:44 min., Frauenstimme Text, Männerstimme Gedicht, keine Musik)
Kurkuma – seit Einzug der asiatischen Küche ist uns das gelbe Pulver als Gewürz relativ bekannt. Eine ganz andere
Bedeutung hatte Kurkuma auf den hohen Inseln der Chuuk Lagune – denn dort galt es als herausragendes Wertobjekt mit
vielen verschiedenen Funktionen.
Ob in größeren Ballen oder zu kleinen Kegeln geformt, die Kurkuma-Paste war Handelsgut und Wertmesser zugleich. Auch
den eigenen Körper schmückte man gerne damit. In der Vitrine sehen Sie verschiedene wertvolle Objekte, wie z.B. die
Armreifen oder die fein gewebten Matten, die mit Kurkuma akzentuiert sind. Auch die dunklen Ponchos, die mit
Spondylusscheiben verziert sind, waren Statussymbole. Besonders außergewöhnlich muten die Kurkuma-gelb gefärbten
Haarraupen an – sie wurden bei Festen und Tänzen getragen und mit den ebenfalls ausgestellten Federkämmen besteckt, so
dass sie wie Vogelschwingen wirkten und den Tänzern ein wahrhaft abenteuerliches Äußeres verschafften.
Doch so verwegen die Tänzer auch aussahen – Tänze und Gesänge wurden immer sorgsam einstudiert und folgten einer
strengen Choreographie. Mit den Gesängen konnte man alte Überlieferungen vermitteln oder auch den Kräften huldigen, die
beispielsweise die Brotfrucht reifen ließen. Bei einem Fest nach der ersten Brotfruchternte sang man zum Beispiel:

Du wirst herunterfallen
So dass mein Land reich ist,
die reiche Brotfrucht
esst die reiche Brotfrucht
damit wir erfrischt werden
an der großen Brotfrucht-Schale

809 – Chuuk, Curcuma (German Version: 1:44 min., text by female voice, poem by male voice, no music)
Curcuma – or turmeric – is relatively well known in the west as a yellow powder used in Asian cooking. But in the High
Islands of the Chuuk Lagoon curcuma is an object of great value with many different functions.
Whether in large bales or shaped into small cones, turmeric paste was both a trading commodity and a standard of value.
People also used it to paint their bodies. In the display case you can see various costly objects like the arm ring or the finely
woven mats that are accentuated using curcuma. The dark ponchos ornamented with spondylus discs were also status
symbols. The most interesting objects are the hair ornaments dyed yellow with curcuma that were worn at festivals and
dances. When studded with the feather combs you see here, their bird-wing-like appearance gave the dancers a wild and
unusual look.
But as wild as the dancers may have appeared, their dances and songs were carefully rehearsed and followed a strict
choreography. The songs told stories from the old oral tradition or praised the forces of nature, like those that made the
breadfruit ripen. At the festival following the first breadfruit harvest people sang:
You will fall down
To make my land rich
The rich breadfruit
Eat the rich breadfruit
To refresh ourselves
At the great breadfruit bowl

Orientation directly at the section seems to be of primary value

together.

4.

Insight
Zooming Closer

If visitors walk along the side of the men’s house model with the
open roof, they tend to use this affordance and zoom closer to get
a view of the inside of the men’s house model. These two
movement patterns belong together.

5.

Wandering Along

As the men’s house model was presented, freestanding visitors
were invited to walk along and around it.

6.

Social Gaze

“Social Gazes” are not connected with the affordances of the
exhibit or the exhibition but with the occurrence of other people
being around.

7.

Long Gaze

The paintings on the men’s house model invite visitors to perform
“Long Gazes” as Aleida Assmann (1995) already correctly
presumed.

8.

Reading Labels

Probably due to where exactly the visitor walks along “The Men’s
House Model from Palau” she is likely or not likely reading the
label.

9.

Changing
Perspective

Although the exhibit is presented freestanding, a change in
perspective is rarely performed. This is rather surprising, as all
three dimensions are offered.

10. Major Orientation
Gaze

“Major Orientation Gazes” seem to be rather characteristic when
entering a new gallery.

11. Backward Gaze
12. Alternating Gaze

The remaining movement patterns of this category are rarely
performed, they seem to be less relevant for this section.

13. Window Shopping

The exhibit was presented freestanding and not within a display
cabinet, hence “Window Shopping” was just not possible.

14. Reading Text Panel

The text panel was put further away from “The Men’s House
Model from Palau”. From the observer perspective in the
systematic observation study presented in Chapter 5 it was not
observable due to other exhibits that obstructed the view. Hence
for reasons of comparability it was not rated in this MET study.

15. Object Scan

Probably due to the small size of the exhibit, “Object Scans” are
less likely.

4. Zooming Closer

Although one might presume that a display cabinet limits
“Zooming Closer”, it does not prevent it. In contrast, especially
the weaving example invites “Zooming Closer”.

5. Turn

Although the exhibits are presented in a display cabinet, “Turns”
are made very often. “Turns” seem to be connected with

6.

Long Gaze

Especially the weaving example invites “Long Gazes”.

7.

Changing
Perspective

Although the exhibit is not presented freestanding, but in a
display cabinet “Changing Perspective” is often performed. This
is rather surprising because one would suppose that presentation
in a display cabinet limits the three-dimensional view.

8.

Window Shopping

As Treinen (1988) already presumed correctly display cabinets
also invite active snoozing and are often walked along without
carefully viewing the exhibits within them, but it seems to
provide enough information to get the gist of the display. Hence
“Window Shopping” is performed as an “initial scanning
mechanism” (Rounds 2004:401) that is guided by the visitors
curiosity and interests (see paragraph 4.4.).

Obviously one can also walk along a display cabinet without

at. But this is rarely performed.

14. Major Orientation

This part describes the results and interpretations of the cued retrospective reporting (CRR)
that was analysed in analysis phase 3 of the first MET study in the “South Sea Oases: Life and
Survival in the Western Pacific” exhibition at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart:
After analysing each video without audio, I watched the videos again but this time with audio
to identify the categories for the content analysis of the CRR.
The CRR was analysed separately after the transcription of the audio files. The relevant parts
were cut and pasted together per section and per visitor group (experts/novices) to analyse the
reports for commonalities and differences between experts and novices with a content
analysis according to Mayring (2010).

Media

Labels

-

Only one statement by an expert at
section 4 “The Heterogeneous Display
Cabinet”.

Audio Guide

-

Only one statement by a female expert
at section 1 “The Men’s House Model
from Palau”. Reason: no audio guide
was available in this visitor study.
Female expert talks about other visitors
she was looking at.

Photographs/Illustrations -

In sum, experts and novices verbalize
equally as much (11:11), whereas at
section 1 “The Men’s House Model
from Palau” nothing is verbalized due to
297

the lack of a photo.

Knowledge

MET

Hands-on Exhibits

-

Only one statement was done by a
female expert at section 4 “The
Heterogeneous Display Cabinet”.
Reason: no hands-on exhibits were
examined by the study. The reporting
was done in reflection of her own
viewing behaviour and what the MET
recorded elsewhere.

Previous Knowledge

-

In sum, experts verbalize more than
novices (8:3).
They have more previous
knowledge, of course.

Lack of Information,
Misunderstandings,
Questions, Unlearned
Issues

-

In sum, experts verbalize more than
novices (70:27).
Experts want to know more about
the exhibits and they are more aware
of their knowledge gaps.

New Knowledge

-

Novices verbalize more than experts
(12:10).
Novices probably learn more due to
their lack of previous knowledge.

Self-reference

-

Only at section 4 “The Heterogeneous
Display Cabinet” by a novice (4:0):
novice learns by self-reference.

MET as a Method

-

At section 1 “The Men’s House Model
from Palau”: one novice about the
quality of the end data/MET video.
At section 2 “The Original Outrigger
Fishing Canoe from Yap”): experts
about how it feels to wear a MET.
In sum, experts verbalize more than
novices (3:1).

Others

One’s Own (Viewing)
Behaviour

-

In sum, experts verbalize more than
novices (59:52).
Reflections about one’s own
viewing behaviour are triggered by
the cue (the visitor’s own MET
video).

Interest

-

Novices verbalize more than experts
(17:9).
Probably a visit by a novice is more
interest-driven or maybe curiosity–
driven (Rounds 2004) than a visit by
298

an expert.
Motivation

-

Only at section 3 “The Homogenous
Display Cabinet”: Experts and novices
(2:1) both verbalize about their nonmotivation of viewing “The
Homogenous Display Cabinet”.

Attention

-

Only one statement by an expert about
his loss of attention viewing “The
Homogenous Display Cabinet”.

Table 26: Summarized Results and Interpretation of the CRR Content Analysis (“South
Oases: Life and Survival in the Western Pacific” Exhibition at the Linden-Museum in
Stuttgart)

Salient results are the three most frequent categories and the categories with zero reporting:
The three most frequent categories are:
-

Identification of exhibit (experts: 99, novices: 65)

-

Lack of knowledge etc. (experts: 70, novices: 27)

-

One’s own viewing behaviour (experts: 59, novices: 52)

The categories with zero reporting are:
-

Experts: self-reference

-

Novices: provenance of exhibit, labels, audio guide, hands-on exhibits and attention.

Apart from that the “previous knowledge” of the experts makes THE difference between
expert reports and novice reports not only regarding the so-called category “previous
knowledge” but also regarding other categories like “identification of the exhibit”,
“provenance”, “workmanship”, and “appraisal” that are associated with “previous
knowledge”.
This difference probably echoes the selection of experts and novices. They were selected only
due to their profession (experts = persons with prior knowledge of the subject matter, e.g.,
students of cultural anthropology; “novices” = persons with only cursory or even no prior
knowledge of the subject matter and with no knowledge about museology, museum education
or exhibition design). No further data about them was collected.
