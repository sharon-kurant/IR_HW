KEY WORDS: Augmented Reality, Cultural Heritage, Mobile Museum Guides, Assisted Learning, Education, Entertainment

ABSTRACT:
Augmented Reality (AR), a computer science field considered by many as a subfield of the broader concept of Mixed Reality, could
alter dramatically the way we interact not only with computers but also with the real environment surrounding us, as well as with
other human beings. Augmented Reality has so far been used for applications linked with military training, medicine, maintenance,
architecture and urban planning, tourism, and entertainment. This last category embraces museums, considered by many not only as
research and exhibition spaces but also as important informal learning environments. Does Augmented Reality has the potential to
break into museum and exhibition environments and revolutionize the way we see, approach and comprehend the exposed exhibits,
alongside with more traditional interpretation and communication methods? This presentation examines both the state of the art in
Augmented Reality Applications for Cultural Heritage and Mobile Multimedia Guides for the museum setting, proposing an
Augmented Reality approach for the last. A taxonomy of augmented and non augmented functions is proposed, aspects of the
development are presented and reasons that could favor or slow down the integration of Augmented Reality in mobile museum
guides are tackled down. The potential mutual benefits both for the Augmented Reality community as well as for cultural heritage
professional are also presented briefly.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Defining Augmented and Mixed Reality
Augmented Reality is a relatively recent computer science field
considered as a subfield of the broader concept of Mixed
Reality. Though the use of the first head mounted display dates
back in 1968, the term started to become widely used after
1993, the year that the ACM Communications magazine
dedicated an entire issue to the subject (Cohen, 1993). One year
later, Paul Milgram et al. (Milgram et al., 1994), in their
approach of classifying Augmented Reality displays, defined
what was thereafter to be known as the "Reality - Virtuality
Continuum" which greatly helped the understanding of the
interrelations between virtual, mixed and augmented reality
environments.

Figure 1: Milgram's et al. Mixed Reality Continuum (courtesy
of Professor Paul Milgram)
Mixed Reality environments are characterized by the
combination of the real with the virtual. If the real world
occupies the left of the continuum, the virtual world stands on
the other end. It is however possible to combine elements of the
surrounding, real world, in a virtual environment (Augmented
Virtuality) as well as to overlay virtual objects in a view of the

real world, if the last is observed or seen by means of a video or
see-through display (Augmented Reality). It is therefore
pertinent to define Mixed Reality (MR) environments as
environments in which "real world and virtual world objects are
presented together within a single display, that is, anywhere
between the extreme of the Reality - Virtuality continuum"
(ibid, p.283).
1.2 Hypotheses about the advantages of Augmented Reality
Augmented Reality is thought to present certain advantages
over more traditional ways of accessing information
(Anastassova, 2007). The co-existence of the real and the virtual
could enhance productivity by facilitating comprehension of
tasks to be performed, in industry, medicine or education. In
education specifically, Augmented Reality has been praised for
its potential in the comprehension of physical phenomena, as
demonstrated by the European "Connect" project (Horn, 2006).
In addition, as the user is assisted by supplementing the existing
world instead of creating a new one, the limited level of
immersion is thought to provoke fewer problems of cyber
sickness. Applications have been so far developed in the
domains of military and medical training, urban planning and
architecture, as well as for industrial maintenance work (eg in
automotive and aerospace industry), entertainment and lately
also for cultural heritage.
1.3 Augmented Reality for Cultural Heritage
Augmented Reality visualizations can provide extremely
meaningful insights when applied in archaeological or historical
parks or museums, not only for the specialist or initiated visitor
but also for the non specialist or first time visitor who has a
difficulty imagining how a site could initially have looked like.

XXI International CIPA Symposium, 01-06 October, Athens, Greece
Fixed Augmented Reality applications have been tested at the
Ename centre in Belgium (Owen et al., 2005) as well as in
Portugal, Brazil and China (Thomasson, 2006), while
experimentations with outdoor mobile Augmented Reality
systems have been carried out in the ARCHEOGUIDE
(Vlahakis et al., 2004; Vlahakis et al., 2005; Vlahakis et al.,
2003) and LIFEPLUS (Papagiannakis et al., 2002) projects.
The complexity of cultural heritage related information is also
apparent in the case of museums and other cultural heritage
institutions where the visitor often needs to be aware of social,
political, cultural, historical, economic or scientific related
aspects in order to better approach and appreciate the exposed
object. It is for this reason that museums provide visitors with a
wide range of interpretation media -textual, visual or auditoryand propose complementary activities in order to help the
public elucidate the narratives revealed by the objects
composing an exhibition. Multimedia and information
technologies have been also employed in this context in various
forms among which fixed position Mixed and Augmented
Reality installations. These systems were reported to generate
enthusiasm among the public (Ferris et al., 2004), encourage
interaction and co-participation (Hindmarsh et al., 2002) and
favor the social character of the museum visit (Galani, 2005).
However rare are still the mobile Augmented Reality
applications tested and implemented in the museum setting
(Sparacino, 2002).
This is quite unfortunate as museums present certain advantages
regarding the overall development of Augmented Reality
applications. Unlike applications designed for outdoor use, the
museum offers a controlled, laboratory like environment
(Damala et al., 2007). Documentation, research and
interpretation are among the missions of museums.
Consequently there exist usually different kinds of resources
and media that can be used to help the visitor approach the
exposed object, a fact that would allow the Augmented Reality
research community examine in depth the way different types of
multimedia can be coupled with Augmented Reality
applications.
This argument leads to the next one: Unlike other Augmented
Reality applications, destined for the experienced in a specific
domain user, museums are open to a wide public, of different
ages and backgrounds, often with little or no knowledge in the
use of computers. Consequently, if Augmented Reality is to
revolutionize the way we interact with computers, with the
surrounding environment and with each other and exploit in full
the benefits regarding the potential social impact, museums
seem to offer an ideal workspace for experimentations on that
field. The design and implementation of a successful prototype
could then easily be tailored to be used under similar
circumstances. As we will see in the next session, museums
have also good reasons to encourage experimentations with
Augmented Reality in their premises.
1.4 Mobile Multimedia Guides in the Museum Setting
Mobile guides, considered as one of the last descendants of
digital, sophisticated audio guides, are becoming more and
more popular throughout the world. Proctor provides a list of
101 projects from 1997 to 2005 (Proctor, 2005). Mobile guides
present numerous advantages as they stand in the cross section
between multimedia and Information Technologies used in the
museum setting and interpretation and communication means
(Damala, 2007). All kind of media can be incorporated in

mobile museum guides' applications in meaningful ways to
guide the visitor throughout the full visit. In addition, mobile
guides are able to be personalized and taking advantage of
geolocalisation capabilities, deliver the right information on the
right spot. Live streaming, bookmarking and communication
possibilities are also key features of mobile guides. In addition,
museum professional can use the logs of visitors' actions to get
meaningful information about the attracting and holding power
of exposed objects as well as about the way the multimedia
resources are used. Despite the fact that evaluation (Damala and
Kockelcorn, 2006) has proved these applications to be effective,
some specific issues demand further attention:
1.

The interaction surface is small and so selecting and
manipulating objects might prove to be a difficult task
especially for the elder or for visitors not acquainted
with mobile technologies.

2.

Geolocalisation is a very helpful feature but often
proves to be not enough as it is not always easy for
visitors to use floor plans of the exhibition space. In
that case knowing the direction towards which the
visitor is looking could be extremely helpful.

3.

Creating links in between the real world and its digital
counterpart is another challenge. Difficulties in
associating a museum object with the available digital
resources could perturb museum visitors that get
easily frustrated when it comes to complex in use
information and communication systems.

And though the above mentioned issues might constitute only a
part of the challenges present in the domain of mobile
multimedia guides used in the museum setting, they lie in the
core of a successful integration of mobile guides in the museum
setting and they are by no way trivial.

Figure 2: Augmenting the real world with digital overlays

Because of a long tradition and history in the domain of virtual
worlds and humans (Bouville and Damala, 2006) and having
participated in the past in two mobile museum guides projects
(Brelot et al., 2005; Damala et al., 2005), our laboratory
conceived the idea of a creation of a new mobile museum guide
prototype, using Augmented Reality techniques. The fusion of
the real with the virtual can transform in unexpected ways the
available interaction surface and help create affinities between
the commented objects and their digital counterparts. This task
is very much helped by Augmented Reality as at every given
moment, the system is aware not only of the geolocalisation of
the visitor but also of his orientation.

XXI International CIPA Symposium, 01-06 October, Athens, Greece
communication, personalization and museum data management.
It is not in the scope of this article to present the full set of
functions we have identified but rather to give pertinent and
adequate examples to establish the proposed taxonomy.
2.2 Contextualization
Contextualization is a term initially used in biblical studies but
steadily adopted from the 70s onwards in cultural studies and
archaeology. It is in this spirit that the term was chosen for our
taxonomy, in order to express all functions that help a visitor
situate a museum object in its original context. The
visualization of images, slideshows, 3d models, animations and
avatars used as virtual guides belong in this category as well as
the audio function, the speech to text or text to speech function
or the video function. Granting to more initiated visitors access
to the museum data base and providing hyperlinks also belongs
in this category as well as all functions allowing the
manipulation of digital artifacts or 3d models.

2. COMBINING AUGMENTED AND NON
AUGMENTED MOBILE MUSEUM GUIDE FUNCTIONS
2.1 Introduction
Mobile museum guides are dotted with a variety of functions in
order to enable not only the visitor but also the museum staff
and the curators to get the best out of their use in the museum
setting. In the case of the Augmented Reality guide, it was
obvious that apart a set of new functions, specifically made
possible by the use of Augmented Reality techniques, other
functions present in systems already implemented should be
identified and included in the guide.
For this reason we created an inventory to which we added the
Augmented Reality functions, that we thoroughly discussed
with museum professionals so as to validate them. Some general
remarks are that:
1.

2.

There are functions visible and invisible to the
museum visitor. The actions activated by the visitor
make part of the first category while functions such as
logging visitors actions for use by museum curators
and educators, or taking under account the number of
terminals used in a specific space and the available
bandwidth in order to optimize the visitor experience
are present but not visible.
There exist a set of Augmented Reality functions.
Their main impact to already tried out non
Augmented Reality functions is that they have the
potential to change the way of interaction as the
"scene" on which the action takes place can move
from a tiny computer screen to the full environment
surrounding as, through, for example the use of
Augmented Reality goggles (Figure 3). The same is
true for the input and output devices that can be used
to interact with the system.

It was felt, however, that a consistent taxonomy that could be
used to better classify the set of identified functions was
missing. This led to a process of a more abstract functions'
classification composed of four categories: Contextualization,

2.3 Communication
Another distinct set of functions is related with the issue of
communication. Communication functions can assist different
kind of communication needs, between the museum and the
visitors, the visitors with the museum, the visitors with other covisitors and eventually address the need of communicating parts
or the full visit for later consultation, linking thus the pre,
during and post visit experience for some visitors and
strengthening the bonds of the museum with its public. The
implementation of a function, that would allow visitors to
spatially comment exhibits could enhance the public dialogue
and engage more the public in the exhibition. Another example
of function is the sending out of alerts regarding closing hours,
or special events taking place in the museum.
2.4 Personalization
Personalization is another great advantage of the use of mobile
guides in the museum setting and can be said to be a function of
its own, composed by different sub functions. In this report we
use the term personalization with its general meaning, including
as well configuration, and without strictly drawing a line
between customization or adaptability, thought to be triggered
by the user itself, and personalization or adaptivity, which lets
the system induce the visitors preferences (Bowen and
Filippini-Fantoni, 2004; Proctor, 2004).
There are many criteria upon which personalization can occur,
like age groups, learning styles (Damala, 2007), disabilities
(Proctor, 2004), level of visitors initiation, available time for the
visit (Damala et al., 2005), thematic tours, bookmarking,
different visitors communities. In a more technical level
personalization can also occur according to the terminal chosen
and the available bandwidth.
2.5 Museum Data Management
Finally, there is a fourth category, completely invisible to the
visitor that plays however a major role in the way the visitor
will live the experience. A common point among all these
functions is that they deal with data, either this is provided or
comes from the surrounding environment or the use of the
devoted visitor's terminal and is directed to the server, or data
that comes as a response from the server to the dedicated
terminal. It is for this reason that we chose to name this

XXI International CIPA Symposium, 01-06 October, Athens, Greece
category "Museum data management", with the term
management embracing the storage, transmission and
processing of data. Registration of visitors terminals, that allows
museum staff be aware of the number of visitors in each room
as well as logs of visitors actions belongs in this category, as
well as geolocalisation, orientation and live streaming. Modules
for content creation, content management and content update
can also fall under this category.

will present him a wealth of multimedia information. The
interaction device would depend on the terminal used and could
be a stylus or the index. In the case of using special Augmented
Reality glasses, it could be also very interesting to attempt to
combine them with a "hand smart" solution, where the visitor's
one palm is transformer in a virtual keyboard (Antoniac et al.,
2001). During the visit, the visitor can communicate with his
co-visitors or other visitors and leave spatial comments
regarding exhibits that can be viewed by his co-visitors and/or
other visitors. The museum can also communicate messages to
the visitors during the guided visit. Personalization helps the
adaptation of the content to the visitor's profile and specific
interests.
3.3 After the Visit

Figure 4: An example of an Augmented Reality mobile museum
guide

In at least one mobile museum guide project personalized
souvenirs were proposed to the visitor (Sauer et al., 2004). As
all visitors actions are logged, useful data regarding the sessions
can be retrieved and help in redesigning or better adapt to
visitors' needs the guide. But there is also another possibility,
already explored and published by the Cite des Sciences et d'
Industrie in Paris (Topalian, 2005). As the visitor returns the
terminal, he receives a postcard onto which there is a url
printed. The visitor can access the content of the web pages
once in front of a PC and visualize the objects he visited and the
path he followed whilst in the museum premises. In that way the
visit is extended beyond the museum and the visitor is given the
chance to examine further specific objects or aspects of the
exhibition.

3. AN AR MOBILE MUSEUM GUIDE: USE CASE
SCENARIO
3.1 Registration
The visitor enters the museum and heads for the kiosk where the
guides are distributed. He registers together with his
companions. This process will later enable him to communicate
with co-visitors and know their exact position in the exhibition
space. It is also required for storing the path visited so as to
later provide the visitor with a unique and completely personal
"souvenir". This very same information of visitor's path is also
useful for the museum personnel. At this point the visitor is
provided with information regarding the use of the terminal.
Different kind of terminals could be available like Tablet PCs,
UMPCs (ultra mobile personal computers) and PDAs without
excluding a future use of the visitors' self owned terminals, e.g.
smartphones. Whatever the choice of the platform, it should
include a camera which will capture in real time the scene the
visitor is looking at so as to augment the viewed scene with
meaningful information. The visitor's terminal is also equipped
with single or double headphones and maybe a special pair of
Augmented Reality see through glasses through which the
visitor will observe the exhibits and the digital overlays instead
of looking them through the screen display.
3.2 During the Visit
The visitor enters the exhibitions and points his device towards
a painting or simply observes the exposed object through his
glasses. The image is captured by the camera and processed by a
special module of the application where the pose estimation is
effectuated. Once this done, it is possible to correctly place the
available information around the observed object in terms of
images, menus, buttons or widgets that activated by the visitor

Figure 5: Augmenting the painting with a detail

4. IMPLEMENTATION ASPECTS
As the scene that the visitor perceives is the real or the video
scene of the surrounding environment augmented with digital
objects, it is very important to cater for a proper alignment and
registration of these last to the real world. Unfortunately and
unlike virtual reality, in Augmented Reality even small errors
are easily perceived by the human visual system. Another very
important factor is the combined latency, else called transport
delay, meaning the delay form the time the measurements are
taken to the time the images appear in Augmented Reality
display (Azuma, 1993).
Both of these factors are crucial to the acceptance and success
of the system but unfortunately no existing approach completely
satisfies these requirements. A possible solution would be to
combine marker tracking with sensor (inertial, ultrasonic, or
radio ranging) and 3d model data. However for the time being

XXI International CIPA Symposium, 01-06 October, Athens, Greece
the marker based approach is the most robust and reliable and
that is the reason for which it was chosen for the first
implementation. In any case, the challenge is to adopt the most
appropriate solution in the more discrete and less obtrusive way
for the museum visitor.
Opting for the marker based approach, the type of museum
objects had to be defined. A decision was taken to proceed with
three different types of museum objects. The first one is
paintings. Apart from being one if the most usual museum
objects, because of their two dimensional and rectangular forms
they can be used as 2d markers, detectable by the Augmented
Reality guide. The second type of objects resides behind
museum transparent showcases. Though the cooperating
museum agreed upon the inclusion of discreet markers in the
showcases, in this case too it could be probable to use the
objects geometry for registration and tracking. However that
would require proper lighting conditions and a minimum of
reflection on the transparent glass showcases. Finally a third
case study will be provided by quadruped stands with a marker
on each side, onto which the possibility of commenting pottery
or statuettes will be explored. In this way the marker base
experimentations will anticipate future improvements in
estimation of camera position and orientation as well as in novel
ways of interacting with Augmented Reality.

5.2 Conclusions
Because of the aforementioned limitations, trying to make
abstraction of the technological constraints is of paramount
importance for the development of Augmented Reality
applications destined for the "museum sphere".
It is also important to remember that museums could provide an
exciting environment for experimentations with Augmented
Reality and one that could help the Augmented Reality
community build in experience that could later be embedded in
other Augmented Reality applications, especially because
museums are extremely rich in content and socially inclusive as
environments.
As technological progress will finally address the need for light
and reliable equipment, robust Augmented Reality algorithms
and dedicated, easy to use authoring tools, Augmented Reality
might provide a valid, intuitive and playful approach towards
the appreciation and comprehensions of tangible and intangible
cultural heritage, opening up the way for other learning or
entertainment Augmented Reality applications.

REFERENCES
This is why the goal of our implementation is not the creation of
a fully fledged Augmented Reality prototype but rather the
creation of numerous Augmented Reality demonstrators first, to
assist museum professionals better comprehend the potential of
the new approach and then adapt it to their specific needs and
secondly to actively involve visitors in Augmented Reality
assisted tasks. Evaluation will eventually prompt interesting
issues regarding the use of mobile guides in the museum setting,
the use of AR for interaction, entertainment and learning.

5. DISCUSSION OF THE AUGMENTED REALITY
APPROACH
5.1 Current limitations of the Augmented Reality approach
Despite the innovative and promising character of Augmented
Reality applications there are still lots of barriers to overcome in
order to ensure consistency and efficacy of the Augmented
Reality approach when it comes to mobile museum guides.
The lack of dedicated authoring tools renders the full chain of
content creation, authoring, implementation and presentation a
difficult task that can not be carried by museum professionals
alone. The innovative character of the approach is often making
bewildering the expression of the needs of museum curators, as
they are not really aware of what to expect and consequently
having a difficulty to express their needs. Technical constraints
related with tracking and correct display as well as the lack of
accurate, powerful and inexpensive equipment is another very
important issue. Therefore, prototype applications are much
more common than viable, ready to be commercialized
applications. It is for the same reason that many Augmented
Reality applications lack a "bottom-up" approach.
Consequently, the process of development is often technology
driven instead of user driven.
