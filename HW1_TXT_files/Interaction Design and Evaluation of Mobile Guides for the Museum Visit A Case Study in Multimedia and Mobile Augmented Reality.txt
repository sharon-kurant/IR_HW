Interaction Design and Evaluation of Mobile Guides for the Museum Visit: A Case Study
in Multimedia and Mobile Augmented Reality
Abstract: This thesis examines the context of use of mobile multimedia handheld guides and
applications as an alternative interpretation medium in the museum environment. Its main
research hypothesis is that the use of mobile Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and the AR
metaphor as a principal component for the conceptual and interaction design of mobile museum
guide applications could greatly facilitate interaction and navigation, both in the mobile
multimedia application and in the sensitive museum ecology.
After examining the context of use of mobile multimedia museum guides, proposing a set of
classification criteria, redefining the notion of interactivity in the specified research context and
examining how AR technologies can shape already existing or future functional requirements, the
main research hypothesis is tested through the design, implementation and evaluation of a mobile
AR museum guide, conceived for a state Museum of Fine Arts (Musée des Beaux Arts), in
Rennes, France. The evaluation methodology is then exposed, before carrying on to the
evaluation of the AR guide. The latter, mainly qualitative in nature, included the use of direct and
indirect observations, semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and two focus group sessions
and shed light on several issues related with the potential but also the constraints of using AR
technologies as an intuitive and easy to understand alternative for geolocalization and orientation
in the museum space and the mobile multimedia application.
The topic treated appertains in the wider domain of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with
mobile devices and services or Mobile Human Computer Interaction (MHCI). However, because
of the specificity of the examined research hypothesis, the thesis also aims to contribute
methodologically, but also empirically, in the current state of the art regarding the interaction,
interaction design and evaluation of mobile AR applications. Finally, due to the nature of the
domain-space in which the experimental interventions took place -the museum environment- the
thesis also sheds light on the ways by which using mobile multimedia guides can alter, transform
or enhance the museum visiting experience and the relations of contemporary museums with
their public.

Etude d’Intéraction et Evaluation de Guides Portables Multimedia pour la visite
culturelle: Des Multimedia à la Réalité Augmentée Mobile
Résumé: Cette thèse examine le contexte d’utilisation des guides portables multimédia comme
aide alternative à la visite culturelle. Son hypothèse de recherche principal est que l’utilisation des
technologies de Réalité Augmente (RA) mobile et de la métaphore introduit par la RA en tant que
component principal de conception et d’interaction concernant les guides multimedia portables,
pourrait énormément faciliter l’interaction et la navigation, tant dans l’application interactif
mobile que dans le contexte sensible du musée.
Le domaine traité appartienne plus largement dans le contexte plus large de l’interaction HommeMachine Mobile. Cependant, à cause de la nature du sujet traite, la thèse apporte aussi des
éléments qui enrichissent l’état de l’art concernant l’interaction et évaluation des applications de
RA mobile. Enfin, a cause de la nature de l’environnement ou l’expérience a eu lieu –le musée- la
thèse apporte aussi des contributions sur les façons avec lesquelles l’utilisation des guides
portables multimedia pour la visite culturelle peut altérer, transformer ou promouvoir
l’expérience de la visite culturelle et les relations du musée contemporain avec ses publics.
Après avoir examiné le contexte d’utilisation des guides portables multimedia pour la visite
culturelle, proposé un set de critères de classification, réexaminé la notion d’interaction dans
notre contexte de recherche et investigué de quelle manière les technologies de RA pourraient
former l’analyse conceptionelle et fonctionnelle des guides portables multimedia, l’hypothèse de
recherche principal est testé a travers la conception, l’implémentation et l’évaluation d’un guide
de RA mobile, créé pour et avec le Musée des Beaux Arts de Rennes. La méthodologie et le
protocole d’évaluation sont ensuite exposés avant de venir aux résultats des sessions d’évaluation
qui ont eu lieu dans l’environnement du Musée. Des observations ont été combinée avec des
entretiens semi-structurées, suivis ensuite d’un questionnaire et deux sessions des entretiens de
group. L’analyse de donnes a démontré plusieurs avantages mais aussi inconvénients lies avec
l’utilisation de la RA comme un alternative intuitive et facile a utiliser pour la geolocalisation,
l’orientation, la navigation et l’interaction tant dans l’environnement du musée que dans
l’environnement de l’application interactive.

Acknowledgements
This work benefited from the continuous support of many “families” of individuals that I would like to
thank here.
Starting by the Orange Labs Research and Development division, in which I performed my first steps in a
Research and Development environment, I would particularly like to thank Christian Bouville and
Danielle Pélé, heads of my research unit for all their encouragement, personal interest and help in many
critical occasions but also for doing their best in providing me, as well as other PhD interns, with all the
necessary material and immaterial “equipment” in order to carry out this work. I also owe to particularly
thank Pascal Houlier and Isabelle Marchal, research engineers in the IAM laboratory, with which I had the
immense pleasure of collaborating for three years. Pascal, Isabelle, I will never be able to thank you
enough for being constantly there, with all possible ways, in touch not only with the practical aspects of
the work undertaken, but also morally and psychologically. I also feel the urge to thank some other
individuals that exercised a great influence in my work: Christian Lecoq, research engineer, for sharing and
publishing with me valuable data from the Mobivisit project as well as Alexandre Cotarmanac’h for
allowing me to take actively part in the DANAE project. With this occasion, I would also like to thank the
DANAE family, for their warm welcome in the team, and more in particular Valerie Ledunois, Marc
Brelot and Hub Kockelkorn, curator at the Museon Museum in the Netherlands for all the wonderful time
we spent while working together. Anne Bationo, ergonomist in Orange Labs, is also to be warmly
thanked, for her advice and interest in the experimentations held in the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes.
The second family of professionals and individuals that I would warmly like to thank are all located in the
Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes. I am particularly grateful to Laurence Imbernon, museum curator, for all
the time she took to work with me on the content of the Augmented Reality guide prototype, as well as to
the team of the museum educators and more in particular, Odile Hays, Carole Marsac, Anne - Sophie
Guerrier. Without their valuable help, their personal investment, their trust, their passion and enthusiasm,
the work related with the main Augmented Reality prototype would have literally been impossible.
The third family is my academic laboratory, “cedric”. Starting from Professors Stephane Natkin and Pierre
Cubaud, with whom I had my first meetings, I would like from this position to particularly thank my
academic supervisor, Pierre Cubaud, for all the time he consecrated in my work, the passionate
discussions (well…sometimes even too passionate!) we have had and the valuable directions he gave me.
However, joining the “cedric group” gave me also the opportunity to create bonds with many other
individuals that I would like to mention here, starting from my colleagues and PhD candidates, FatimaZahra Kaghat, Pedro Alessio, Rodrigo Almeida and Shuo-Hsu-Sian. I am also more than happy for having
met or/and worked with Eric Gressier-Soudan, Jerome Dupire, Françoise Shailan, Cecile Le Prado,
Isabelle Astic, Colline Aunis, and Vivian Gal. Having all met you makes me feel particularly happy, lucky
and privileged for joining the lab; this is the reason for which I am sure that many of the moments we
spent together will be engraved in my memory as some of the happiest of my life.
The fourth family that I have to thank is the family I joined as soon as I moved from Rennes to Paris:
these are the people I met while living in the Cite Internationale de Paris and more in particular in the
Hellenic Foundation (Fondation Hellenique). To all of my friends and neighbors as well as to the
direction, administration, maintenance and security agents of this historical institution I owe a great thank.
Finally, I also want to thank my friend Manolis Delakis for substantially helping me out with the final
proofreading of this PhD report.
Last, but certainly not least, comes my own family for its continuous and unreserved support. It is to my
mother, my father, my brother and my beloved grandmother that I co-dedicate this work.

Famous Blue Raincoat
It’s four in the morning, the end of December
I’m writing you now just to see if you’re better
New York is cold, but I like where I’m living
There’s music on Clinton street all through the evening.
I hear that you’re building your little house deep in the desert
You’re living for nothing now, I hope you’re keeping some kind of record.
Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?
Ah, the last time we saw you, you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You’d been to the station to meet every train
And you came home without Lily Marlene
And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody’s wife.
Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well I see Jane’s awake -She sends her regards.
And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you,
I’m glad you stood in my way.
If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free.
Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried.
And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear

Sincerely,
L. Cohen

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 SCOPE OF THE THESIS

This thesis examines the context of use of mobile multimedia handheld guides and applications
as an alternative interpretation medium in the museum environment. Its main research
hypothesis is that the use of mobile Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and the AR metaphor
as a principal component for the conceptual and interaction design of mobile museum guide
applications could greatly facilitate interaction and navigation both in the mobile multimedia
application and in the sensitive museum ecology.
The topic treated appertains in the wider domain of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with
mobile devices and services or Mobile Human Computer Interaction (MHCI). However, because
of the specificity of the examined research hypothesis, the thesis additionally aims to contribute
methodologically but also empirically in the current state of the art regarding the interaction,
interaction design and evaluation of mobile AR applications. Finally, due to the nature of the
domain-space in which the experimental interventions took place, the museum environment, the
thesis also sheds light on the ways by which using mobile multimedia guides can alter, transform
or enhance the museum visiting experience and the relations of contemporary museums with
their public.
1.2 RESEARCH MOTIVATIONS

1.2.1 UNDERSTANDING MOBILE CONTEXTS

Mobile information and communication devices and services are spreading globally with a pace
that has never been seen before, especially if one compares with the slower pace of adoption of
office information systems. Initially conceived at the late 1970s and early 1980s in Japan and
Scandinavia, mobile phones and telephony have undergone a considerable transition from a
technology-focused professional tool to a show-off gadget and lately a mass-market consumer
product adopted by hundreds of millions of people globally (Kiljander, 2004). Indisputably,
currently, owning a mobile phone has largely become a norm as well as a social necessity, at least
in western and developed societies.

25

The spread of mobile telephony and the change that everyday communications underwent in
everyday life is not the only important change witnessed in the course of the last years. Together
with the possibility of communicating with anyone, anywhere, anytime, other forms of
communication and use of mobile devices and services started to emerge. The most illustrative
example is provided by the largely unpredicted success of the short message service (SMS),
currently one of the most widely used data applications on the planet (Baron et al., 2006),
representing a massive industry reported to worth globally over 80 billion dollars in 2006 (ITU,
2006).
As storage and processing power capacities do not cease to evolve and the population gets more
and more accustomed in owning, using and manipulating mobile devices, a large variety of other
multimedia applications became available to such a degree that we are now facing the
“convergence” phenomenon: the transformation of mobile phones to devices that can read and
send mail, play music, store photographs, be used as playing platforms, provide navigation and
way-finding assistance, act as video and audio recorders or even as e-wallets. For countries in the
avant-garde of new technologies appropriation, like Japan, it has been argued that mobiles have
become more important than house keys, serving not only for the consultation of digital content
but also as a remote control for many other devices (Sukemoto, 2004).
A common parameter of all these developments is that, in most of the cases, it is the user needs
as well as the users’ patterns of behaviors that shape future directions for services, devices and
products and not just simply the industry (Harper, 2003). The possibilities seem still very rich and
diverse as, despite the remarkable advances in mobile computing, there are still target groups (like
for example senior citizens (Love, 2005) as well as types and contexts of applications that just
start to get explored.
At a time where our contemporary knowledge society sets new requirements for training and
education with an accentuated emphasis on lifelong learning, one of the least explored and most
promising challenges regarding mobile computing is to understand how mobile and tangible
devices and technologies can be used in order to better support learning (Vavoula and
Karagiannidis, 2005). Mobile learning has the potential to adapt to the learner’s preferences and
capabilities and to accompany learning not only in formal but also in informal learning
environments seamlessly and discretely, featuring new, engaging and interactive activities
(Naismith et al., 2006). The New Media Consortium (NMC), an international not-for-profit
consortium regrouping nearly 300 learning-focused organizations has since 2006 consecrating
parts of its annual “Horizon” report in the ways mobile technologies can be used to enhance on-

26

site, collaborative and interactive learning in formal and informal learning environments (NMC,
2009).
Within this scope, the introduction and use of mobile audio and multimedia guides in the
museum environment can be considered as a distinct category of mobile, interactive and
multimedia edutainment application. The next section focuses on the particularities of the
context in which the PhD Thesis interventions and experimentations took place, the museum
environment.

1.2.2 MUSEUMS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE

The last decades have seen museums all over the globe literally re-inventing themselves (Valance,
2007). Since the 1970s, the western industrialized world has been witnessing a “boom” both in
relative museum numbers but also in terms of role and influence exercised in our contemporary
societies. In Europe, it is estimated that for each museum that existed in the 1950s, four exist
today (Ambrose and Paine, 2006), while in the United States attendance of museums doubled
from 200 million in 1965 to nearly 400 million in 1984 and 500 million some years later,
rendering thus museum visiting as the one of the most popular family activities in America (Falk
and Dierking, 1992). And though this trend cannot but be viewed positively, adverse
consequences can also be observed. In Germany, for example, the number of museums increased
by 30% in between 1991-1996 but the public’s attendance only by 5% (Burton and Scott, 2007).
Museums are thus competing not only with each other but also with other venues and attractions
for a public that has less time available than ever before.
However, the most decisive change of the last decades is not the increase in terms of existing
museum numbers but the increasing “opening up” of the museums and their collections to their
public. In other words, museums passed from a state of “being about something” to “being
about somebody” (Weil, 2007); and while they have been characterized at their first state as
“elitist” (Schubert, 2000) or “static” storehouses, mainly focused on the acquisition, preservation
and study of their collection that was subsequently presented as something objective and rational
without further discussion or explanation (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994), today museums seem to
understand that public exhibition and interpretation is at least equally if not more important than
collection and research. Reflective of this tendency is that during the 1990s in Australia and the
USA many museums devoted more resources to visitor and audience research than to any other
activity (Griffin and Abraham, 2007).

27

At a time when we observe a developing emphasis on lifelong learning regarding both formal and
informal learning environments, the museum setting -defined by the International Council of
Museums (ICOM) as “a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its
development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and
exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of
education, study and enjoyment” (ICOM, 2007)- seems to represent an ideal, multisensory,
informal learning environment, open to and able to satisfy a wide public, of different ages,
abilities and backgrounds (Dierking, 2007).
The importance of this particular character of a museum visit is also strengthened by the
common assumption that museums and other cultural heritage related institutions incorporate
not simply objects, but the intellectual values, history and tradition of the society, thus
emphasizing the continuity between the previous and the upcoming generations. This is also the
reason for which the public sees in museums a leisure activity, closely connected with learning,
and differentiated from other “short-term thrills” attractions (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994).
As the change in terms of focus and mission of museums is changing, museum visitors are valued
more and more as active meaning makers with a right to a meaningful and informative experience
when engaged in a museum visit (Berger, 2004, Doering, 2007, Falk and Dierking, 1992,
Schubert, 2000). Museums therefore are now more than ever before experimenting with different
strategies and different media not only in order to assist their visitors in getting the most out of a
museum visit but also in order to create long lasting relationships with their public. Educational
programs for families and schools, guided visits for individuals or handicapped people, audio
guides, hands-on workshops and multimedia applications represent now some of the standard
interpretation media visitors are provided with in many museums and cultural institutions.
Under this scope, the introduction of lightweight handheld multimedia guides as personalized
assistants for interpretation purposes can be seen as one of the latest trends regarding museum
educational and interpretation policies, providing a spectrum of functions that will be further
examined in the next chapters (particularly in Chapter 2 and 4). On the other hand, examined
under the scope of the MHCI community, museums, because of their public and educational
character, seem to represent an ideal testbed for experimentations with mobile computing,
mobile learning and entertainment applications.

1.3 THE RESEARCH SETTING

This study has been conducted in an industrial and business-driven Research and Development
environment, France Telecom R&D (currently Orange Labs), in Cesson Sevigné, France. France
Telecom is primarily a telecommunications provider, though lately a number of other services are
also proposed to companies and the large public in several countries in Europe, Asia (Peking,
Japan) and USA (San Francisco, Boston). The R&D division employs approximately 3000
engineers who deploy their research in the fields of signal processing and telecommunications,
but also in other computer science disciplines, ranging from image, video and audio coding, to
networks, information systems, multimedia, and interaction design.
The France Telecom R&D laboratory that hosted the internship, IRIS (Image, Rich Media, New
Interactions and Hyperlanguages), has been particularly active in Virtual (VR) and Augmented
Reality (AR) environments including intelligent, 3D avatars and agents. Some example
applications is the 3D visualization of the city of Rennes for which a 3D interactive visualisation
tool was developed allowing to access information on public services (location, opening hours,
etc.), public transportation (location, timetable) or sport installations. Virtual Collaborative
Environments is another axis of research and experimentations aiming to explore and investigate
novel interface solutions. The work performed on intelligent avatars on the other hand, aims to
develop a more user-friendly and entertaining access to distant communication services.
Augmented Reality (AR) has been lately representing another important sector of research for the
IRIS lab. The Augmented Reality (AR) concept aims to enhance our real world perception,
combining it with fictitious, computer generated objects. Some of the related topics of research
are the development of computer vision algorithms enabling robust and accurate bindings
between real and virtual worlds, the definition of new metaphors in order to control the
interactions between the virtual world and the coexisting real world, and hardware developments
for appropriate visualization systems (for instance see-through glasses). The possible market for
AR applications can be industrial (maintenance, assembly), personal (gaming, support for
disabled and elderly people, online shopping), mobile (geolocalized services, gaming), artistic,
medical or educational. However, as AR is a relatively young and discipline, AR applications have
been so far mostly addressed to a very marginal public related with specific disciplines (medical
and military training, architecture, urban planning, industrial maintenance etc). Within this scope,
the public and rich in connotations character of the museum environment renders museums very
interesting as experimentation environments for mobile AR applications.

The PhD thesis research also benefited from a very close collaboration with the research team
Médias Interactifs et Mobilité (Interactive Media and Mobility) of the CEDRIC laboratory in the
Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, Paris, France. Some of the main research activities
are related with the conception of multimodal, interactive 2D and 3D interfaces (visual and
auditory) and the development of tools and environments for the authoring of multimedia
applications. Particular emphasis is given on the techniques of conception and development of
video games as well as on mobile multimedia applications and digital libraries. The laboratory
maintains close relations with the Musée des Arts et Métiers and has been actively involved in the
digitisation of the virtual library of the Conservatoire (cnum.cnam.fr), featuring more than 600
000 digitised pages, among which some very important 19th century journals, of particular interest
for the scientific community of the History of Science.
1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS

In the previous sections the amalgamation of the PhD topic, as a result of both the author’s
motivations and objectives and the research motivations and activities of the settings in which
this study was undertaken was examined. More in particular, and with a chronological order, the
research questions that were formed are the following:
-

What is the context of use of mobile multimedia museum guides and how do they differ
or complement other already existing interpretation means? Which are the current
challenges and barriers involved in the conception, implementation and integration of this
interpretation medium in the museum environment?

-

In which ways interaction while using a mobile multimedia museum guide differs from
other cases of mobile human computer interaction?

-

Can mobile AR technologies and the AR metaphor constitute an interesting alternative
for interaction and navigation in a mobile multimedia museum guide application but also
in the sensitive museum ecology? Can AR facilitate orientation in navigation in the
museum space and the interactive application? Is mobile AR easy and intuitive to
understand even by non experienced IT users? Are there any new emerging ideas
regarding possible ways of interaction with mobile AR applications?

The research and methodological approach adopted for answering these questions is visited in
the next section.

1.5 RESEARCH APPROACH AND METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

The nature of the treated topic implied from the very beginning an interdisciplinary approach. As
a consequence the research and methodology employed associated resources from the domains
of human computer interaction (HCI), augmented reality (AR), interaction design, museum and
visitor studies and evaluation. The study also benefited by the ongoing progress and research in
the field of cultural informatics, a concept broad enough to accommodate work carried out in
diverse fields such as databases, digitization, computer animation, virtual and augmented reality
and interaction design and evaluation, employed for the documentation and interpretation of
cultural heritage and cultural heritage related applications.
In more practical terms the literature review was combined with hands-on experience in three
projects (DANAE, Mobivisit and Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes projects), numerous on-site
museum visits and multifaceted fieldwork undertaken in order to conceive, design, author and
evaluate a mobile multimedia guide using mobile AR technologies and the AR metaphor as the
predominant geolocalization, orientation and navigation component. Finally, the main AR
prototype, built in order to explore the main research hypothesis through the integration of the
AR metaphor in a mobile multimedia museum guide, was largely conceived and evaluated using
participatory design practices which resulted in informative feedback that was taken under
consideration in the next- financed by the French National Agency for Research (Agence
National de Recherche) - phase of the mobile AR guide of the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes.

1.7 STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS

Including the present introductory chapter, the thesis is composed of 7 chapters and is divided in
two parts. Part A, composed of chapters 1, 2 and 3 lays the theoretical foundations regarding the
main research hypothesis. Part B, composed of chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7, explores and tests this
research hypothesis, through the iterative design, implementation and evaluation of a mobile AR
guide for a contemporary French state museum of Fine Arts.
Chapter 1 introduces the topic, the research problem, the motivations and the objectives of the
work undertaken, the research questions as well as some methodological issues and briefly
discusses the main contributions and outcomes of the research.

32

Chapter 2, "Mobile Multimedia Guides in the Museum Setting”, presents the state of the art in
mobile multimedia guides for the museum setting, a topic that provided the initial canvas for the
main research hypothesis to be deployed. This chapter introduces a set of classification criteria
regarding mobile multimedia museum guides (media employed, geolocalization capabilities, data
storage, platform type, platform ownership, personalization, collaborative applications,
edutainment activities) in order to better comprehend the context of use and the potential of the
examined application type. Particular emphasis is given on the different strategies employed for
resolving geolocalization and navigation issues, both in the museum space and the interactive
application, while two mobile museum guide projects, in which the author participated, Mobivisit
and DANAE, are presented in more detail. This chapter also highlights human, economical and
technological challenges and barriers to overcome that have been so far preventing the
generalization of use of mobile multimedia guides in the museum context.
Having provided a theoretical background regarding the modalities of use of mobile museum
guides, Chapter 3, “Introducing Augmented Reality for Mobile Multimedia Museum Guides”,
looks deeper into the complex issue of interaction with mobile devices in the museum
environment. After analyzing the ways in which a visitor’s attention gets fuzzily allocated among
the museum guide and the surrounding environment (the museum object and other co-visitors),
the main research hypothesis is introduced: that the use of a still emerging technology,
Augmented Reality (AR), and the corresponding metaphor it introduces, might have the potential
to enrich and facilitate the interaction of a museum visitor with the museum environment and the
interactive application. The chapter then introduces and defines AR, looks into principal
components of mobile AR systems, examines prominent types of applications and potential
current and future displays. A state of the art particular to the current uses of AR in the Cultural
Heritage domain is then proposed as well as the potential but also the current limitations of the
AR approach.
After exposing the main research hypothesis examined by this thesis, the second part of the
dissertation examines in detail the modalities involved in the design, implementation, content
creation, assessment and evaluation of a mobile AR museum guide created for and with the
Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, France.
Chapter 4, “Design and Implementation of the AR Guide”, begins by elucidating the first
necessary steps taken towards the creation of an AR enabled mobile museum guide, through the
making-up of a comprehensive functions list. Each function is investigated separately, together
with a short overview of the ways AR could be employed to alter the overall user experience. The

33

first AR mobile museum guide prototype, designed, implemented and assessed in the lab and
several international conferences is then presented, as it formed the basis for the accepted
proposal addressed to the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes. The rest of the chapter examines the
different stakeholders’ needs, the research setting (the museum) and the iterative design process
employed. The content creation process both in terms of interactive edutainment content and
scenarios and content authoring is also exposed as well as the reasons that led the museum
professionals in picking-up as a target group young people, aged between 18 and 30 years old.
Chapter 5, Methodology for Evaluation and Data Collection”, is dedicated to the main
methodological issues that shaped the planning of the evaluation process. Two relative sections
examine current practices regarding mobile multimedia museum guides, and identify trends,
practices, challenges and deadlocks in the evaluation of mobile Augmented Reality applications.
After proposing a taxonomy for the evaluation of mobile museum guides and investigating the
reasons for which evaluation is still underutilized among the AR scientific community, the main
research questions that shaped the methodology and the protocol finally employed for the
experimentations are put forward. The 1st group of questions is related with the AR character of
the proposed intervention. The 2nd group of questions is more generic to the usefulness, the
enjoyability and the overall impact of the use of a mobile multimedia guide in the museum
environment. The remaining of the chapter looks into the evaluation protocol proposed for the
experimentations in the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, consisting of direct and indirect
observations, semi-structured interviews, the use of a survey and two focus groups. 12
participants, aged between 18 and 22 years old, representing two distinct museum visitors groups,
frequent and occasional museum visitors participated in these experimentations. The chapter
closes presenting the task and experimental setup of the experimentations.
Chapter 6, “Data Analysis and Results”, is dedicated not only to the results obtained but also to
the ways through which the data coming from all employed evaluation methods was analyzed.
Each evaluation session (participatory observations, semi structured interviews, questionnaire,
focus groups) is presented separately, using recurring issues that aroused before, during or even
after the experimentations. An attempt to combine in a meaningful and coherent way data from
all phases of the experimentation, so as to more effectively answer the main research questions is
also provided, trying –whenever it is possible- to draw the line between AR- and non AR-related
aspects sought by the museum experimentations.
Chapter 7, “Conclusions and Future Work”, resumes the main thesis contributions both
regarding the use of mobile museum guides and the AR character of the examined intervention,

34

which was found indeed appropriate as an alternative proposition for navigation and orientation
both in the museum space and the interactive mobile museum application. A critical appraisal of
the mobile AR approach is also proposed before passing on to future work directions within a
short term and long term horizon.

CHAPTER 2
MOBILE MULTIMEDIA GUIDES IN THE MUSEUM SETTING
2.1 INTRODUCTION

Why are mobile guides introduced in the museum setting? Which needs does this new
interpretation medium seek to fulfill? In order to better comprehend the context of this
intervention we first focus on the issue of interpretation in the museum environment. Having
defined this way the potential residing in every mobile museum guide project, we introduce a set
of criteria that can serve as a method for the classification of relevant projects but also as a mean
for the description of functional requirements.
Two mobile museum guide projects in which the author participated, DANAE and MOBIVISIT
are presented in more detail, using the proposed criteria, with particular emphasis on orientation
and geolocalization issues. Finally, human, technological and economical barriers related with the
design, the implementation and the adoption of mobile museum guides are also exposed.

2.2 A CROSSROAD BETWEEN TRADITION AND INNOVATION

In order to better understand where mobile multimedia guides stand in the museum environment
we have to consider that they make part both of what is widely known as museum interpretation media
as well as part of what is known as multimedia and information technologies in the museum setting (Figure
2.1). This remark is essential with regards to the conceptualization, the design and the evaluation
of applications for museum handheld devices.

Figure 2.1: Mobile guides in the museum setting: a crossroad between tradition and innovation
Over the years, museums have slowly but steadily been transforming themselves from scientific
environments addressed to a strict elite, to institutions embracing a plethora of activities in order
to allow to a wide public, of different ages, backgrounds and abilities the apprehension of

37

mankind’s material and immaterial culture (Weil, 2007). In short, museums all over the world are
becoming more and more aware of their potential and mission to act not only as scientific and
research environments but also as educational and entertainment environments, serving thus with
multiple ways human societies and their development (ICOM, 2007). We usually refer to the
different means provided by the museum to the public for the apprehension and interpretation of
museum exhibits, as interpretation media (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000). These may include text in a
variety of forms (exhibits’ etiquettes placed near the exhibits, printed brochures, paper guides),
audio guides, guided visits, educational programs, multimedia installations and other multimedia
products, like for example museum web-sites or other digital editions. In this context, mobile
multimedia guides can be seen as one of the newest media introduced in the museum for the
interpretation of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage.
But apart from constituting an interpretation medium, mobile museum guides make also part of
multimedia and information technologies in the museum setting. This category includes documentation
databases that complement, replace or co-exist with physical archives, museum web sites used for
communication, documentation and interpretation purposes, interactive multimedia exhibits and
installations, digital audio guides and information systems and multimedia used for publishing. In
addition, information technologies in the museum are also used for administration purposes like
for example ticketing or transactions taking place in the museum shop.
It is therefore not arbitrary to allege that this new medium stands in the cross-section of these two
categories, allowing thus the coupling of the instances belonging to both classes. Multimediaenabled mobile museum guides can hypothetically deliver all kind of interpretation material
already used in the museum and also benefit and communicate with other multimedia and
information systems used in the museum for various purposes. Combining elements of both
categories, results in different functional requirements that this chapter will progressively explore.
It is however obvious that mobile multimedia guides can provide an intelligent platform that can
be used for a variety of purposes serving not only the need for communication between the
museum and its visitors but also evaluation and administration purposes. The potential of this new
medium will be explored in the remaining of this chapter.

2.3 CRITERIA OF CLASSIFICATION FOR MOBILE GUIDES IN THE MUSEUM
SETTING

Introducing criteria of classification is not only a step towards establishing taxonomies, but also a
very efficient way of presenting an overview of the possible functions mobile museum guides can
integrate. The examination of mobile multimedia guides’ projects using the proposed criteria,
allows the identification of the main research questions each project seeks to explore. Finally, the
systematization of the criteria leads also to a better comprehension of open issues to address and
barriers to overcome.

2.3.1 1ST CRITERION: MEDIA USED

The first criterion upon which mobile guides can be classified is provided by the type of media
they can deliver. This criterion will also allow us to historically approach the evolution of the
examined medium.

2.3.1.1 Audio Guides
The most ancient predecessor of mobile multimedia guides is said to be the 1957 reel-to-reel tape
audio guide produced for the house of Franklin Roosevelt, in Springwood, USA, with his wife,
Eleanor, being the narrator (Leigh, 2007). A compact version of this first magnetic cassette player
can be seen in Figure 2.2a. The introduction of Sony walkman in 1979 apart from revolutionizing
music listening habits altered also the landscape in museums and other cultural heritage
institutions. Walkmans were enthusiastically adopted by museums around the world, despite the
fact that the audio commentaries were confined to limited duration, linear delivery and one single
language per cassette and device. In museums of the size of Pergamon Museum in Berlin, it was
not uncommon to pass in front of gigantic cupboards in which audio guides were classified by
delivery language.
Without any doubts, the transition from the analogue to the digital, in 1994, dramatically changed
the scenery in audio guidance systems (Proctor and Tellis, 2003). Visitors were now provided with
the possibility to roam in the content in a way that had nothing to do with the linear, predefined
navigation in the analogue audio guide’s sequences. The storage capabilities of the new digital
audio guides also allowed the creation of rich thematic tours and the delivery of audio content in
several languages.

39

Figure 2.2.2a-2.2d: Generations of Audio Guides. From left to right: a compact reel-to-reel cassette player (A),
sony’s walkman (B) and two mp3-audio guides(C, D).
Today, commercial audio guidance systems propose mp3 systems that can store up to 550 hours
of audio (Acoustiguide, last accessed November 2, 2008), in multiple languages, with easy
switching from one language to another, while integrating sophisticated modules that give the
possibility to collect and store visitors’ data for later analysis. Some of these guides are also dotted
with Infrared and RFID capabilities for triggering appropriate content, while accompanying
software, assisting museum professionals in managing the audio content (add or delete audio files,
or update the content) has also made its appearance.
Lately another approach for the delivery of audio commentaries is the creation of mp3 tours and
podcasts that can be directly downloaded to visitors’ self owned terminals (Samis and Pau, 2006)
or cell phones (Nickerson, 2005). The content may be either released by the museum itself (e.g.
Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of
Art, National Gallery London etc) or other entities, as is the case with BBC’s “Take One
Museum” TV show (BBC, Last accessed November 2, 2008).

2.3.1.2 Multimedia Guides
The history of mobile multimedia guides is closely linked with this of mobile computing. Though
the release of the 1st PDA, Apple’s Newton, occurred only in 1993, the 1st mobile museum guide
project, the iGo guide for the Minneapolis Institute of Art, dates back to 1994 (email
communication, James Ockuly, September 3rd 2008). As suggested by their name, multimedia
guides can combine all different types of media: text, audio, image and video and include other
interactive features. Though mobile multimedia guides are still far from being the norm, Nancy
Proctor lists 101 mobile museum guide projects released until 2005 (Proctor, 2005). This record is
valuable, as many of these projects were discontinued and/or never published, conditions
rendering extremely difficult the systematic review of some early projects. In this context, the two
"electronic guidebook" forums organized by the Exploratorium, in San Francisco, in which many
active in the domain professionals participated, constitute a precious source of ideas, experiences

40

and guidelines (Exploratorium, 2001, Exploratorium, 2005). Equally interesting is the now
discontinued action of the CIMI Handscape consortium (Spinazze, 2002), which from 2001 to
2004 sought to investigate use-cases of mobile multimedia guides in museums and art galleries. In
Europe, the first known project is the 1997 European HIPS project that set the goal of creating a
portable multimedia guide, both for indoor and outdoor use, as early as 1997 (Broadbent and
Marti, 1997) while over the Atlantic, the Exploratorium, a popular science museum in San
Francisco, launched one of the first handheld guides in 1998 (Hsi, 2002). Today, far more services
and possibilities seem possible than ever before. In addition, to the knowledge of the author, a
german product, Xpedeo (Xpedeo, last accessed October 31st, 2008), also proposes software
allowing museum professionals to create the guide’s content alone.
It is important to notice that in the international bibliography, there exist several ways of reference
to this kind of devices and projects. During the early days, these devices were referred to as
museum handheld devices (Cabrera et al., 2005, Ciavarella and Paternò, 2004, Exploratorium,
2005, Hart, October 2005, Kwak, 2004, Manning and Glenda, 2004, Olson, 2007, Pham, 2004,
Proctor, 2004, Schmalstieg and Wagner, 2005, Tellis, 2004). “Mobile museum guides” (Albertini et
al., 2005, Butz, 2002, Damala and Kockelkorn, 2006a, Damala and Kockelkorn, 2006b, Damala,
2007a, Damala, 2007b, Oppermann and Sprecht, 1998, Santoro et al., 2007) and “nomadic
devices” (Brelot et al., 2005, Damala et al., 2005, Hsi, 2004, Vlahakis et al., 2005) are other
variations often enough used in the relevant literature.

2.3.1.3 Visio Guides
Despite the fact that today’s mobile multimedia platforms can deliver all kind of media types,
sometimes, a conscious choice is taken so that museum handheld guides provide only audio
content together with minimal visual information. In this sense, chronologically, visio guides are
not predecessors of mobile multimedia guides, but rather successors. Visio guides have been used
in the “Brush in History” exhibition in the Smithsonian Institute, in New York (Olson, 2004) as
well as in the “Rembrandt’s Late Religious Portraits” exhibition that took place in the J.P. Getty
Institute (Hart, October 2005). The visitors activated thumbnails of the images to access the
relevant audio content.
If visio guides can be considered as a sub-category of multimedia guides, the same does not hold
true for a new generation of audio guides, like the guide created by Acoustiguide for the British
Museum on the occasion of the Hadrian: “Empire and Conflict” exhibition in July 2008 (on site
visit and testing of the guide by the author on Sunday 27th of July). The wand-form audio guide

41

proposed was dotted with a small screen, used to show the image of the commented exhibit not
for navigation purposes but as a constant visual reminder of the commented work.

2.3.1.4 Multimedia, Augmented Reality-Enabled Guides
Finally, a last but still emerging category of guides could be linked with the use of Augmented
Reality technologies, as the one that will be exposed in this PhD thesis. These guides are equipped
with a camera that captures the surrounding environment in real time and uses it as a canvas for
the delivery of multimedia information by superimposing on the video of the real environment
virtual overlays with which the user can interact. The main motivations regarding this approach,
including design, implementation and evaluation issues are systematically explored from Chapter 3
onwards.
Experiments with mobile Augmented Reality systems have taken place in the archaeological site in
Ancient Olympia, Greece (Vlahakis et al., 2004, Vlahakis et al., 2003) and in the participating
museums of the “Ecsite” project (Anastopoulou and Sotiriou, 2005). Experimentations in a
museum environment have also been conducted by the German team of the Weimar University,
but using cell phones as delivery platforms (Bruns et al., 2005). Mobile, multimedia, Augmented
Reality-enabled guides are very promising, as in the near future, technological innovations could
imply great changes not only regarding visual displays but also human computer interaction with
mobile devices and services.

2.3.2 2ND CRITERION: GEOLOCALIZATION

2.3.2.1 Introduction
Geolocalization or localization is an issue of great importance concerning a museum visit. This is
because, regardless of the nature of the interpretation medium employed, a museum visitor needs
to know how to make the link between the interpretation material used and the object to which it
refers, to correlate the signifier with the signified.
Nancy Proctor, in her article “Off-Base or On Target? Pros and Cons of Wireless and LocationAware Applications in the Museum”, not only discusses this issue, but also provides a valuable list
of 101 mobile museum guides’ systems, in their majority never published, grouped by
geolocalization or triggering technology (Proctor, 2005). Here we will follow her classification also
introducing a somewhat different approach, by proposing that more generally, there are three
possible ways the signifier can be correlated with the signified. The link can be in the museum

42

physical environment, on or within the interpretation medium, or in both environments. The third
solution is the most widely spread.

Figure 2.3a-2.3g: A. Tate Modern, London. B. Eternal Egypt project. C. Mackintosh Center, Glasgow. D.
Natural History Museum, Tokyo. E. Natural History Museum, London. F. Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie,
Paris. G. Vincent Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.
Whatever the solution, the task in many cases remains difficult to achieve. This is why mobile
guides in the museum setting do not only promise to deliver rich multimedia and multisensory
content but also to assist museum visitors in accessing the right information on the right spot
(Oppermann and Sprecht 2000). Technically this may be achieved using a variety of techniques
and underlying technologies, which the remaining of this section, sets to explore. Each solution
presents advantages and disadvantages which should be examined carefully before opting for one
or the other solution.
However, geolocalization capabilities can do much more than just help visitors locate themselves
in the museum premises. For example, they can reveal to the museum personnel the exact
position of each visitor, allowing thus a control of visitors flow. Versailles in France was very
interested in such a possibility that would allow a better management and control of visitors flow
during periods of great visitor affluence (Interview of the author with Christian LeCoq, France
Telecom RD, November 8th, 2004). Geolocalization could also allow visitors to know and
visualize where other co-visitors are found in the museum. For example, Danae project for
Museon museum in the Netherlands included such a function, in order to assist co-registered
visitors, e.g. the members of a family, locate the position of other members of the group (Brelot et
al., 2005). A slightly different in nature example is provided by Legoland in Denmark where a
geolocalization system based on RFID tags is used in order to detect the location of children that

43

get lost in the park (Collins, 2004). At the same time, geolocalization can also be a prerequisite for
edutainment, computer-supported collaborative applications. The rest of this section explores the
different geolocalization methods employed in mobile museum guide projects.

2.3.2.2 Declarative/ Explicit Geolocalization (using alphanumeric or visual clues)
Geolocalization or localization during a museum visit is not an issue proper only to the use of
mobile multimedia guides. The use of any kind of interpretation media is strongly linked with the
notion of the domain space. However, the closest pre-existing practices in the museum premises
can be detected in the museum-object identification scheme utilized in audio guides; audio guides
have been using museum etiquettes next to exhibits to indicate to the visitor that a work is
commented and provide him with the number to access this resource (Figure 2.4a). This system is
also often used when delivering mobile multimedia guides, sometimes in conjunction or as an
alternative to other geolocalization means (Figure 2.4a).

Figure 2.4a-2.4c: Examples of declarative (explicit) geolocalization. Conservatoire National des Arts et
Métiers(A), Paris and Tate Modern, London (B, C).
Another way of helping the visitor during the visit is to use the above mentioned method together
with a photo or thumbnail of the commented exhibit that presumably helps the user in identifying
the commented exhibits (Figure 4b). This was the approach used in the children’s mobile
multimedia guide provided by Sycomore for the Gauguin exhibition in Paris’ Galleries du Grand
Palais (Calabre, 2004). It has been also used in the Mobivisit project described in section 2.3, by
the recent multimedia guide of the Louvre (Louvre, 2008) and by the British museum in the 2008
temporary “Hadrian: Empire and Conflict” exhibition (BritishMuseum, last accessed October
31st, 2008). The guide, created by Acoustiguide, was essentially an audio guide and had the form
of a normal telephone headset dotted with a screen that constantly displayed the image of the
commented exhibit. A disadvantage of this solution is that museum galleries are often large and do
not favour the immediate visual identification of the commented work. Another issue is that the
unrealistic rendering of the colours of an original work may have the same effect (Damala, 2005).

44

A 3rd approach that can be used in conjunction with the above, is to provide the visitor with a
digital plan of the exhibition on which he/she is asked to locate himself, locate where the
commented work is, and then figure out his trail towards this spot (Figure 4b). Though this
solution is more and more available in mobile multimedia guides, it seems at times that it is
overestimated. Evaluation (Damala et al., 2005) and extended observation sessions of the author
in several museums have shown that this approach is not easy to use. It comes therefore as a
surprise to see that it is employed under all circumstances, as is the case in Tate Modern Gallery,
proposing this solution not only in the adults’ tour but also in the tour destined for children (on
site visit, July 27th 2008). DANAE project, described more in detail in section 2.4, also used a plan
of the gallery to assist visitors in the localization of the commented exhibits. Finally a last way of
declarative aid in geolocalization was used in Mobivisit project where visitors were asked to fill in a
three-field form that then returned as a result their position on a digital map (Damala et al., 2005).

2.3.2.3 Bluetooth Geolocalization
Bluetooth is the name of a standard developed by many electronic manufacturers including Nokia,
Ericsson, Siemens, Motorola and Toshiba. It took its name after Harald Bluetooth, king of
Denmark in the late 900s who managed to unite Denmark and part of Norway into a single
kingdom and introduced Christianity into Denmark after managing to negotiate with different,
opposite parties. It is precisely for this reason that Bluetooth logo features the runic characters for
H and B.
Bluetooth is a radiofrequency standard using a frequency of 2.45 GHz which has been reserved by
international agreement. Bluetooth devices avoid interfering with each other by using very week
signals in conjunction with a technique called spread-spectrum frequency hopping. This means
that the working frequency changes randomly 1600 times per second, thus minimising the
possibility of a same frequency used by different paired devices. Bluetooth is used by a variety of
devices ranging from mobile phones to garage doors, and baby monitors.
One of the advantages of Bluetooth is that it does not require line-of-sight between
communicating devices. A maximum of eight devices can be connected simultaneously in a radius
of 10 meters creating a Personal Area Network or Piconet. Furthermore the Bluetooth protocol
demands much less energy that the more power-demanding Wi-Fi protocol.
As Bluetooth was developed as a low-powered, low-bandwidth (1Mbit/second) protocol, it was
finally used more as a communication protocol for connecting mobile phones between them or

45

with printers or computers. In museums it can be used as a triggering technology of short-range,
that cannot really deliver rich multimedia content. This is why Bluetooth has only been used once
in a museum environment, in the Tussauds’ museum in London (Proctor, 2005) in form of
Bluetooth triggers that activated PDA, locally-stored content. Bluetooth triggering functions the
same way as infrared triggering described in the next session. Using Bluetooth for triggering could
be an interesting alternative for visually impaired visitors as it does not require line-of-sight.

2.3.2.4 RFID
RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) refers to technologies using radio waves to automatically
identify objects. In today’s everyday life the term is most used for systems using an RFID receiver
in conjunction with small RFID chips attached to an object. In the museum environment, the chip
can be attached to objects easy to carry, such us a watch, a bracelet, or a card (Figure 2.5b). This
item is then sending its ID to the network by means of the RFID transceiver mounted on the
exhibit. The transceiver records and sends the visitor identification number to the network and the
database system while also tracking the actual path of the visitor in the exhibition. However in the
case of Carrara museum in Italy, the use of passive RFID tags forced visitors to approach very
closely to the artworks and were subsequently replaced with active RFID tags (Santoro et al.,
2007).
RFID does not require line-of-sight. Exploratorium in San Francisco has experimented with
RFID technologies as several studies showed that users preferred to have their hands free while
wandering in the museum. Visitors could bookmark information and take photos of them in front
of exhibits that were available on line in a personal web page (Hsi, 2005, Hsi et al., 2004).
A slightly different approach has been adapted by a Gallery in New Hampshire, USA. RFID chips
were placed next to the artworks. Visitors can borrow one of the three PDAs together with an
RFID - Bluetooth pen. They trigger that way information about the artwork on display, then
bluetoothed to the PDA that displays that way information on the selected work (Proctor, 2005).
The RFID technology was also tested in the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers museum
in Paris, France (Merdassi et al., 2007).

2.3.2.5 Infrared Geolocalization
The infrared protocol of communication supports data rates almost as high as a WLAN and does
not interfere with other devices. On the disadvantages is that it is a “line-of-sight” technology that
requires a “clear” path between the trigger, placed above a door or in a room, and the handhelds’
infrared receiver. Infrared triggering (tagging) can be used both for delivery of locally stored
content as well as for delivery through a wireless network and can be passive or active. Active
triggers cause the activation of the appropriate content while passive triggers need to be activated
by visitors.
There exist as well small infrared “tags” that are designed so as to be placed discreetly next to the
exhibits or even built in exhibit labels (Proctor, 2005). However it might be difficult for visitors to
approach if there are many persons in the same room. Infrared tags come with special software
that allows updating and management of the content associated with each tag. The system can also
alert the administrator if the batteries of the tag are running low.

Figure 2.6a-2.6c: Infrared audio guide, Museum of Musical Instruments (MIM), Brussels
Museums that have been experimenting with the infrared technology is the Marble Museum in
Carrara (Ciavarella and Paternò, 2004), la Cite des Sciences et de l’Industrie in Paris (Proctor,
2005) and the National Museum of Cinema in Turin, Italy (Monaci and Cigliano, 2003). Infrared

47

technology was also used in Seoul’s Leeum museum where walking up to a work triggers an
Infrared sensor prompting the PDA to introduce the exhibit with text and recorded voice (Choi,
2005). The same principle applies also to an infrared audio guide proposed by the Museum of
Musical Instruments in Brussels, Belgium (on site visit, August 3rd 2008). The particularity of the
guide is that it consists only of an infrared headset equipped with an antenna. Special spots are
designated in form of circle in front of the musical instruments showcases. The visitor has to step
on them in order to listen via the headset to the music produced by the instruments (Figure 2.6a2.6c).

2.3.2.6 Wi-Fi Geolocalization
Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) technology allows devices to connect to the Internet/Intranet in a range
of 100 meters without demanding line-of-sight. This technology is based on IEEE 802.11
specifications. Wi-Fi can connect potentially unlimited visitors with a theoretical data transfer of
54Mbit/second. The high bandwidth delivery to Wi-Fi enabled devices provided the possibility of
remote content storage and automatic content update from a single, central server.
In terms of function, four elements are necessary to a wireless network: a central server where the
positioning software is installed and where the location calculations are made, several access points
that relay radio signals between the visitors and the server, Ethernet cables and switches, to
connect the access points to the server, and finally the Wi-Fi enabled terminals (Proctor, 2005).
When visitors move around the museum, the handheld devices send signals to the access points.
With signals of at least 3 access points (triangulation) and the parallel use of a radio map, the
positioning software can calculate each visitor’s location with a granularity of 1 to 3 meters,
depending on the circumstances (from walls and iron objects that can interfere with the signal to
humidity and number of visitors in the same room). For further “tuning”, Wi-Fi technology can
be combined with infrared, radio or Bluetooth triggers (Proctor, 2005).
Among the drawbacks of Wi-Fi we find the inaccuracy in location readings and the latency of
content delivery. Though latency and accuracy can be improved by augmenting the number of
access points, most museums prefer local storage of the content, even when they are equipped
with wireless networks, as visitors can scarcely tolerate delays of more than a few seconds Proctor,
2005). Other disadvantages include the high cost involved in the deployment and maintenance of
a wireless network and the extra effort needed to discreetly install the necessary infrastructure in
the museum premises in a way that will not perturb the design and aesthetics of the exhibition.

48

Regarding the visitor terminals, another disadvantage is the high power consumption that makes
battery life and heat a concern. Some of the museums that have experimented with Wi-Fi
technologies are the Tate Modern, in London (Proctor, 2005), the Singapore Science Center (IDA,
June 22, 2005), the Museo e Certosa di San Martino and the Institute and Museum of the History
of Science in Florence (Galasso et al., 2004).

2.3.3 3RD CRITERION: CONTENT AND MEDIA STORAGE

The proliferation of wireless networks and delivery protocols and the geolocalization capabilities
of mobile devices gave the possibility for the creation of new services relying on the transfer of
remotely stored content. In the museum context we can now draw the line between museum
guides that have all content stored locally, and guides that can retrieve content from a remote
server.
This 2nd possibility opens up a new spectrum in functions and interactivity possibilities as content
can dynamically be generated as a response to visitors’ input. At the same time as the delivery of
rich multimedia content demands lots of storage space, wireless delivery can potentially provide
limitless content in real time. Collaborative activities are very much depending on the
interconnection and exchange of information between different application modules. Polling,
voting or leaving spatial messages to encourage public dialogue regarding exhibits could also be
favoured by the use of wireless technologies. Finally, administrative tasks, visitors-flow
management and automatic update of content can also be benefited by wireless content delivery.

2.3.4 4TH CRITERION: PERSONALIZATION

Personalization is a key issue regarding the design and implementation of mobile museum guides
(Walker, 2007, Wang et al. 2007). For museum professionals, this is also one well known issue, as
the educational and recreational character of the museum visit imposes different approaches in the
proposed activities (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994, Jensen, 2004). At the same time, in the field of HCI,
personalization is clearly recognised as an issue of particular interest. The same holds true for
mobile human computer interaction (MHCI), where personalization is lately not only an issue
regarding provided services, but also devices (Cheverst and Schmidt-Belz, 2005). Historically, for
many, personalization remains a notion closely linked with the Internet. However the origins can
be traced back to the first interactive role-playing games, where players chose a personality whose
power and characteristics were developed by gaining in experience (Gee, 2003).

49

Customization and personalization are two terms that are often loosely employed. In reality a
distinction is possible to be made between these two terms: Customization or adaptability occurs
when the user creates a profile manually, removing or adding elements and thus configuring the
interface, while personalization or adaptation is used when referring to a system that automatically
modifies its characteristics according to the user needs (Filippini-Fantoni, 2003), either explicitly,
from information provided by the user, or implicitly, by monitoring the application context (Brelot
et al., 2005) or the performed actions (Bowen and Filippini-Fantoni, 2004). For the needs of this
study however, we shall consider the two terms as equal.
Generally speaking, personalization is supposed to promote the filtering and adaptation of
information to the user, facilitate navigation and therefore increase the speed of access to the
application content. Parameters that can be taken under consideration are age, interests, level of
education, previous knowledge etc.
Through the literature review carried out, both regarding the use of mobile guides in the museum
as well as regarding current museum practices, nine criteria and services upon which
personalization acquires its full meaning were identified. All criteria can be either applied alone or
in combination between them. More specifically, personalization may be provided according to:
1.

Age groups: The content of a mobile multimedia guide can be conceived and implemented

in such a way, so as to provide different commentaries and activities according to the age group of
museum visitors. This possibility has been used in many mobile museum guides projects, such as
the Sycomore guide for the Gauguin exhibition in Paris in the Grand Palais (Calabre, 2004) or the
Tate Modern multimedia guide that offers an adults and a children/family tour (on site visit, July
27th 2008). Tours especially created for school classes have also been implemented and reported to
be successful (Cabrera et al., 2005).

2.

Available languages: Another issue that could be addressed through personalization is that

of language, as already demonstrated by the mp3 audio guides that are available in a plethora of
museums around the world and have replaced the older cassette audio guides (Proctor and Tellis,
2003). One of the latest examples is the mobile multimedia guide designed and implemented for
the Louvre, launched on February 2008, where the content is available in seven spoken languages
and the French sign language (Louvre, 2008).

3.

Visiting trails/bookmarking: In “That’s Canada exhibition” in “La Cite des Sciences et de

l’Industrie”, museum visitors were provided with a PDA equipped with an infrared receptor. Each

50

time a visitor approached a zone of interest he/she could point his PDA to the tag to trigger the
appropriate content. One of the activities consisted of visitors posing for a photograph in front of
different exhibition-inspired fonts. The path followed by the visitor as well as the photograph
taken were afterwards available in a personal web page, which could be accessed by means of a
code distributed to visitors after the restitution of the PDA (Topalian, 2005). Roland Topalian
reports that, for this particular exhibition, 56.500 cyberlogs were accessed, for 47.726 tracked
visits. Bookmarking using a combination of RFID and Wi-Fi was also experimented in the
Exploratorium in San Francisco (Hsi, 2005, Hsi et al., 2004). The Getty museum also planned to
add a quintessence of personalization in its PDA guide, planned for launch in May 2004 (Bowen
and Filippini-Fantoni, 2004). The guide would provide audio descriptions, images, text and
interactive maps and would give visitors the possibility to bookmark up to 50 objects, accessible
after the visit either on a personal web page or directly to the visitors’ e-mail inbox. Another
technique used for bookmarking consists of using barcodes distributed to visitors prior to the visit
and activated by them each time they want to leave a “trail” that can be later consulted on a
personal web page. This method is currently employed in the Museon museum, in Hague, the
Netherlands.

4.

Thematic visits: Another feature easy to implement in order to accommodate visitors

different interests and needs, is the setting up of thematic visits. Taking again as an example the
Louvre (Louvre, 2008), which is one of the first large museums in the world to offer a mobile
multimedia guide, the 1st version of the guide released in February 2008 proposed nine thematic
visits while in the 2nd version foreseen to be released in 2009, six additional thematic tours would
be added (Louvre, 2008). Thematic tours were also proposed in the Mobivisit guide of the
museum of Fine Arts in Lyon (Damala et al., 2005). In this category one should also add tours
more or less detailed according to visitors particular interests and expertise. Other personalization
issues that could be addressed have to do with the level of expertise of the visitors, their age, their
particular interest in selected topics or available time. In the future, the use of metadata (CIDOC,
2006) could facilitate the automatic generation of thematic tours based on criteria such as different
periods, materials etc. This type of personalized merchandise could be easily translated in a
separate mobile museum guide module.

5.

Personalized merchandise: Museums are non-profit institutions based mainly on tight state

funding, private donations and revenues from admissions. In this context, museum shops can
contribute to a greater or lesser degree in raising funds (Kotler and Kotler, 1998). Based on
bookmarking of visitors’ favorite exhibits, personalized merchandise could be proposed to

51

visitors, shortly before the end of the visit. The guide of the Senckenberg paleontological museum
provides such an example. Visitors were provided with the possibility to take their own photos
that were then forwarded to their email while collaboration with a telecommunications company
enabled visitors to order personalized souvenirs with their favourite dinosaurs on them (Sauer et
al., 2004, Sauer and Goebel, 2003).

Another very recent example comes from the United

Kingdom. Visitors of the National Gallery in London can enter the museum shop, consult a
multimedia kiosk, then order and buy in real time a poster of their favourite painting in a size
ranging from A4 (210 x 297 mm) to A0 (841 x 1189 mm) for a price ranging from 10£ to 75 £
(on-site visit, July 26th 2008).

6.

Visitors’ special abilities: There exists no better example to illustrate the advantages of

personalization than this concerning visitors with special abilities. A guide for deaf or hearing
impaired visitors was tested in Great Blacks in Wax Museum, in Baltimore, Maryland, and was
then officially launched in Tate Modern, London, in October 2003 where it is still (July 2008)
available (Proctor, 2004). This example has been followed by the Louvre recently (though of
course it is not a coincidence that the same company undertook the creation of both guides). The
plethora of geolocalization capabilities have also allowed the design and development of guides
also destined to visually impaired visitors, as demonstrated in (Bellotti et al., 2003) and (Ghiani et
al., 2008) based on RFID localisation, specifically developed to guide and help in orientation
visually impaired people and inform them that they can touch an exposed exhibit.

7.

These two examples could also inspire interface design and personalization for aged

people facing problems with their vision (Proctor, 2004). An option that would let the user define
the size and colour of the font could be very easy to implement. Yet, to our knowledge, no
museum handheld guide has ever considered this option.

8.

Visitor groups or communities: Another criterion is strongly linked with the social

character of the museum visit. Though still not very common, there have been examples of
mobile museum guides conceived also to be used by more than one visitor. This aspect is further
examined in sections 2.4.5 and 2.5.7 where “social context” and “edutainment” aspects are
examined.

9.

Delivery platforms: As further examined in section 2.3, where the Mobivisit project is

presented, in the future, visitors might use their self-owned terminals in order to download and

52

use multimedia interactive interpretation material. When this happens, the presentation of the
content should be automatically adapted to the capabilities of the visitor owned terminal that will
host the application. In this context, the DANAE project, examined in section 2.4, set as a goal to
explore the requirements and the possible impact of providing visitors with such a possibility.

Figure 2. 7a-2.7b: The Great Black Wax museum deaf or hard-of-hearing guide (A) and two deaf visitors using
the Tate Modern Multimedia Tour (B), (Proctor, 2004)
2.3.5 5TH CRITERION: SOCIAL CONTEXT

Undeniably museum visits are often also social in nature (Pujol and Economou, 2006).Studies
have shown that especially among non frequent visitors, sharing the visiting experience is
sometimes more important than the educational aspect of the museum visit itself (Hood, 1983).
At the same time, an increasing number of museums attempts to involve museum visitors in a
public dialogue around exhibits, proposing to the visitors polling and voting using multimedia
kiosks, as for example is the case in Berlin’s Jewish Museum (on-site visit, April 2007) and Museon
museum in the Netherlands (on-site visit, February 2006). Taking under account the unanticipated
success of SMS messaging, especially among young people, for communicating and keeping in
touch (Grinter and Palen, 2002), the integration of communication services in mobile museum
guides might in the future develop much faster than it has up till today (Arvanitis, 2005).
Concerning mobile museum guides, a conceptual schema was provided in the study of Woodruff
et al. (Woodruff et al., 2001), supporting that the visitor interacts with three entities when using a
mobile multimedia guide in the museum environment: the information source (e.g. the
guidebook), other companions and the location itself. It seems however that for non-frequent

53

visitors the need to share the experience with other companions is sometimes a higher priority.
The same team also experimented with a prototype that allowed visitors to hear the audio
sequences their companion was hearing when not engaged in an audio presentation (Woodruff et
al., 2002). The PEACH project (Stock and Zangarano, 2007) also set out as a goal to explore this
possibility and created a module that allowed a small group of visitors consisting of three to four
persons to communicate using predefined or personal messages or “place” on exhibits “post-it”
comments that they wanted their companions to see.
Alternative combinations regarding the way museum visitors communicate include the study
conducted for “The Museum Detective Game”, which set as a goal to explore the paired
discovery of an art object in a museum, as in contrast with the much more common task of
individual discovery of several objects. The evaluation that followed (16 pairs of pupils) proved
that the children managed to use the guides cooperatively and that they retained an increased
amount of factual data, that was however comparable with more traditional “hands-on” activities
proposed by the museum (Thom-Santelli et al., 2006). A collaborative visit for pupils visiting in
pairs but this time equipped each with one PDA was also planned for the Dionysios Solomos
Museum in Zakynthos, Greece (Cabrera et al., 2005). Another approach was proposed by Brown
et al. (Brown et al., 2003, Galani, 2005); a mixed reality system allowed the mutual discovery of the
Mackintosh house in England where three, different in terms of location, visitors collaborated
during a museum visit.
As communication using mobile devices in situations of mobility becomes an increasingly crucial
field of study in mobile human computer interaction, several projects have also been launched for
an outdoor use. For example Arvanitis examined the way students used their camera-equipped
mobile phones to communicate information regarding open air monuments in the city of
Thessaloniki, in Greece (Arvanitis, 2005).

2.3.6 6TH CRITERION: CONTINUITY OF USAGE

The 6th criterion introduced is the continuity of usage. Continuity of usage might have two
declinations. In the 1st case, the mobile museum guide might have an outdoor counterpart, for
example, an outdoor guide (Wood and Donovan, 2004) might be combined with an indoor
museum guide. Concerning Cultural Heritage, this approach presents a great interest in the case of
open-air excavated archaeological sites that house archaeological museums where the findings of
the excavations are presented (Luyten and Coninx, 2004). A system in this case might help the
visitor to visualize the links between everyday objects discovered in archeological digs and the

54

exact location in which they were found, highlighting affinities and correlations otherwise difficult
to perceive. However, to the author’s knowledge, with the exception of an indoor Augmented
Reality system tested for archaeological training purposes, such a system does not yet exist. In the
few examples that exist in the bibliography, the continuity of usage is perceived as a combination
of use of an outdoor tourist guide with an indoor museum guide as is the case with the “Eternal
Egypt” (Tolva and Martin, 2004) project and Mobivisit (Damala et al., 2005), presented in section
2.4.
The 2nd declination is more museum-specific. The idea behind it is that more and more often,
museum visitors plan in advance their museum visit, for example by consultation of the museum
web site. In addition sometimes visitors extend the benefits of the museum visit, by looking up
relative information, before the visit ( Haaparanta & Ketamo, 2005) or after the visit has ended
(Bowen and Filippini-Fantoni, 2004, Wessel et al., 2007, Kuflik et al., 2007)). Therefore, the idea
of deploying a system that could accompany the visitor in all of the proposed pre- and post-visit
activities, strengthening also the bonds of the museum with its public, can not but be of great
interest and importance for museum professionals. Though few projects have so far examined this
possibility, some first findings presented are very encouraging. For example, Topalian mentions
that the Visit+ system that tracks museum visits and proposes to visitors personalized web pages
for later consultation, had until 2005 generated a total of 104,000 Web sites and about 70,000 hits
of coming back visitors (Topalian, 2005).
This notion of continuity has been examined by one of the earliest related projects, the HIPS
(hippie) project, in 1999. The team proposed in the form of a scenario a system that would allow
the visitor to access web pages before the visit, browse exhibits and setup a tour. During the visit
visitors could access the artworks catalogue and look for the exhibits, while once at home they
could have access to a fully personalized information space with objects seen in the museum
where they could search for additional information (Oppermann et al., 1999). Linking the visit and
the post-visit phase was also examined in the case of the Electronic Guidebook, created for the
Exploratorium, in San Francisco (Fleck et al., 2002). In England, the science center “At-Bristol”
invites visitors to email pictures and web links to themselves for consultation after the visit
(Spinazze, 2002). A variation is provided by the PEACH project, where visitors following the visit,
are provided with personalized recommendations of other cultural sites they might want to
explore (Callaway et al., 2005).
An examination of all related projects shows that the majority of existing applications are
developed either for indoor (Galasso et al., 2004, Exploratorium, 2005, Proctor and Burton,

55

2003) or outdoor applications separately (Borntrager et al., 2003), and that only in a few cases, a
museum multimedia guide has been developed, to include an outdoor counterpart as well (Hall et
al., 2001).

2.3.7 7TH CRITERION: EDUTAINMENT

About one third of museum and gallery audiences are made up by children accompanied by their
families (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994). As interactivity and action is vital for children, a perception
that the visit will be fun is crucial (Mazzone et al., 2004). Therefore educational games for museum
handheld devices constitute an alternative to PDA escorted guided visits, especially attractive for
children. But even considering adults, games and other edutainment activities can favour
interaction and learning by triggering curiosity and engagement physically, mentally and
emotionally and can also enhance the social character of the museum visit (Falk and Dierking,
1992).
Games and other play-like approaches are also fundamental for learning. As museum learning
involves most of the time specific objects, games can introduce several non conventional ways for
observing, contemplating and interacting with them while encouraging individuals to construct
their own meaning based on other already acquired personal experiences (Hein et al., 1998,
Damala, 2007b).
Games on PDA are widely used for education purposes not only in museums but also in other
formal and informal learning settings and for different scientific domains ranging from biology
(Rudavsky, 2003) and forensic sciences (Crane, 2006), to

architecture, history of art and

archaeology.
Multimedia games created for museum handheld devices can be solitary games (Sauer et al., 2004,
Sauer and Goebel, 2003, Bellotti et al., 2004) or team games (Bellotti et al., 2004, Broadbent and
Marti, 1997, Brown et al., 2003, Cabrera et al., 2005, Crane, 2006, Hall et al., 2001, Kwak, 2004,
Laurillau and Paterno, 2004, Studierstube, 2005, Yatani et al., 2004, Thom-Santelli et al., 2006).
Further on, teams can be consisted of individuals (Bellotti et al., 2004, Broadbent and Marti, 1997,
Brown et al., 2003, Crane, 2006, Khan, 2004, Laurillau and Paterno, 2004, MIT, 2003, Sauer et al.,
2004, Sauer and Goebel, 2003, Studierstube, 2005) or groups of two or more persons (Hall et al.,
2001, Kwak, 2004, Studierstube, 2005, Thom-Santelli et al., 2006, Yatani et al., 2004, Cabrera et al.,
2005). We could define as collaborative games all team games where different teams or team
members have the possibility to communicate in between them. Communication can be
synchronous -as is the case with most of the games examined- or asynchronous (Bellotti et al.,

56

2004). Further on, according to Laurillau and Paterno (Laurillau and Paterno, 2004), two kind of
collaborative games exist. The first category supports explicitly cooperation and sharing while the
second one supports implicitly cooperation through individual activities. We believe that this
distinction could be further defined by adding a third category where explicit collaboration and
knowledge sharing is demanded between group members and implicit collaboration is expected
between different groups participating in the game.
Another distinction can be made according to whether the games played are based on the use of
one or multiple platforms (Brelot et al., 2005, Brown et al., 2003, Hall et al., 2001, Sauer and
Goebel, 2003, Schmalstieg and Wagner, 2005). Other platforms might include stationary
workstations, video projections or other devices such as head mounted displays (Hall et al., 2001).
For example, in an austrian project, the reward for the young museum detectives was given in the
form of video-sequences clues displayed on a large monitor that made the narrative progress
(Schmalstieg and Wagner, 2005).
The place or space where the game takes place can also be used for classification purposes. Three
categories can be distinguished. Outdoor games in cities, historical or archaeological sites (Bellotti
et al., 2004), indoor games in museums and galleries (Broadbent and Marti, 1997, Brown et al.,
2003, Cabrera et al., 2005, Crane, 2006, Khan, 2004, Kwak, 2004, Laurillau and Paterno, 2004,
MIT, 2003, Sauer et al., 2004, Schmalstieg and Wagner, 2005, Studierstube, 2005, Thom-Santelli et
al., 2006, Yatani et al., 2004) and games that combine tasks that should be accomplished both in
an indoor and an outdoor environment (Hall et al., 2001). Outdoor games as well as games
combining indoor and outdoor tasks are clearly under-represented.
It is also worth mentioning that the games can take place in a variety of computer environments.
By environments here we mean simple 2D environments (Broadbent and Marti, 1997, Cabrera et
al., 2005, Crane, 2006, Khan, 2004, Kwak, 2004, Laurillau and Paterno, 2004, MIT, 2003, ThomSantelli et al., 2006, Yatani et al., 2004, Bellotti et al., 2004), 3D environments (Sauer et al., 2004),
mixed or augmented reality environments (Schmalstieg and Wagner, 2005, Studierstube, 2005) as
well as combinations of all the above (Hall et al., 2001, Sauer and Goebel, 2003, Brown et al.,
2003). The last example can be illustrated by an application designed for the Equator project, for
the Mackintosh Interpretation Center, in Glasgow where a shared mixed reality system for visiting
the museum was created. Ten group visits of three persons were organized so that for each group,
one person was physically visiting the museum using a PDA, while the other two were visiting
virtually using a web page and a virtual reality replica of the museum, respectively. All three of
them were able to see where the other two visitors were (Brown et al., 2003). Another example,

57

using augmented reality is illustrated by the “virtuoso” project, an application conceived to teach
students history of art. The players, using their PDAs, visualize different artworks that have to
place in the correct chronological order (Studierstube, 2005).
As for the nature of the games themselves it is important to highlight that they are often inspired
by already well known educational museum games. The most familiar of these games are “treasure
hunt” games, or observation games where participants have to search in the museum an element,
more or less crucial depending on the scenario of the story (Laurillau and Paterno, 2004). Hidden
in puzzle pieces artworks as well as scrabbled images or verses the player has to restore (Cabrera et
al., 2005) can be considered as digital counterparts of this sort of game. Another type of game,
closely related to the aforementioned, is the “mystery” or detective game, where players,
individually or in groups have to solve a mystery case which most of the times consists of finding
evidence about one or several objects in the museum (Cabrera et al., 2005, Hall et al., 2001, Khan,
2004, Kwak, 2004, Laurillau and Paterno, 2004, Sauer et al., 2004, Sauer and Goebel, 2003,
Schmalstieg and Wagner, 2005, Thom-Santelli et al., 2006, Yatani et al., 2004). In some cases, apart
from the evidence that can be gathered through observation of the exposed objects, players can
also interview characters, use databases or other embodied equipment such as microscopes
(Crane, 2006, MIT, 2003). The mystery or detective games are sometimes also using elements
from role-playing games, inciting players to choose a specific character and collaborate with other
game characters. For example, in the exceptional Questacon-CSI game, conceived to familiarize
students with forensic sciences, players are asked to participate in a homicide investigation using
one of the following characters: detective, lab technician, forensic pathologist or criminal
psychologist (Crane, 2006).
Another interesting scenario was proposed by one of the first PDA projects to be undertaken for
the museum environment, as early as 1997. A school group visits a natural history museum. Each
pupil takes a PDA. The class is separated in two groups: the predators and the prey. The predators
have to identify, using several clues -such as sounds, diagrams, maps- what animals they are and
then identify their designated prey in the museum. The prey team is assigned with the same task.
When a predator finds its prey or the prey spots the predator the system informs the successful
pupil as well as the unfortunate counterpart that he/she has been eaten. The team with the most
survivors wins (Broadbent and Marti, 1997).
Sometimes some extra functionalities are added such as taking photographs, or manipulating and
modifying 3d objects, as is the case with Dinohunter, implemented for the Senckenberg
Paleontological museum in Frankfurt (Sauer et al., 2004, Sauer and Goebel, 2003).

58

In order to classify the nature of games present in handheld devices used in the cultural section
heritage, Belotti et al. (Bellotti et al., 2004), proceeded in a very helpful distinction of three kinds
of games: observation games (e.g. reconstructing an image, find the differences or the missing
details, answer to multiple choice questions or associate images), reflection games (e.g. answer
questions that demand critical reasoning), or video, arcade games that can take a variety of forms
depending on the hosting institution. Many of them do not really seem to have an educational
value but, as Gee remarks (Gee, 2003), arcade games might help children learn very effectively
even if learners are so caught up in their goal that they do not realize they are learning. Computer
games can take many forms apart from adventure games. In the surrealist game of Tate Modern,
visitors are asked to create creatures by choosing their face, body and feet. In the Dialogue
Museum in Belgium, MARIPOSA (Lefftz et al., 2003) features an interactive game for the painting
“Cathedral of Pilsen”, of Willem Van Gene. Around the main theme many, secondary themes are
arranged depicting a variety of topics. They serve as a frame to the work and they are so many that
the visitor hardly notices them. The interactive game recreates a new paint by using only the
secondary themes and prompts the user to click on each theme. Upon the click the user hears
sounds susceptible to be produced in the depicted environments (e.g. a theatre full of people, a
train station with a train arriving etc). This example illustrates a game very simple in its conception
that redirects the visitor’s attention on the exposed work of art (Damala, 2004).
Finally it should be noted that games, as part of the educational material that can be included in a
handheld device, can have available features for the pre-visit phase as well as for the post-visit
phase. In most of the cases the post-visit related material is received by means of email.
Exploratorium in San Francisco (Hsi, 2005), Dinohunter in Senckenberg Paleontological museum
(Sauer and Goebel, 2003) and the guide developed for the exhibition “That’s Canada”
(Duconseille and Rabussier, 2003, Topalian, 2005) provide examples illustrating this approach.
The number of evaluation studies carried out for edutainment material on museum handheld
devices is significantly inferior to this concerning the effectiveness of use of handheld devices in
the museum setting. To the author’s knowledge there is only one available study concerning the
effectiveness of PDA delivered educational games in comparison with traditional educational
paper and pencil quests. The results showed that the retention of information was almost equal in
both cases (Thom-Santelli et al., 2006). Due to the lack of results for assessing the effectiveness of
computer aided learning, we find appropriate to refer to an experimentation conducted in South
Africa regarding the retention of information relevant with traditional stories of African tribes.
Schoolchildren were separated in two teams. The first one listened to a narrator reading a story

59

while the second one was able to experience the story by means of a “cave” installation. Both
groups were then asked to fill in gaps and answer questions. Retention of factual information was
higher by students who only heard the story but the willingness to find out more about the
particular African tribe was much higher among the children that followed the computer-version
of the story. This possibly means that children were attracted by the overall setting of the scenes
and the storytelling and therefore paid less attention to the actual information. However this
experience motivated them a lot in finding out more elements about the tribe (Ladeira and Blake,
2004). These results present some similarities with another experimentation of a PDA guide
implemented for the Genoa Costa Aquarium, which set out as a goal to observe whether audio
guides or PDA guides are more effective concerning learning. In the questions asked after the visit
the group that used the audio guides presented a greater retention of verbal facts while the PDA
users performed much better in descriptive tasks (Bellotti et al., 2002).

2.3.8 8TH CRITERION: DELIVERY PLATFORM-TYPE

The proliferation of mobile computing and wireless technologies has led to a multitude of
available platforms that can be considered for use in the museum. PDAs are by far the most
common platform, selected for the majority of related projects. A first distinction can be made in
between Pocket PC and Palm OS operating systems. Pocket PCs are the most widely used in
museums. They are more expensive that Palm OS but they have larger screens, higher resolution
and support the landscape mode. Palm OS on the contrary are cheaper, have a longer battery life
but support only two ways of text entry instead of four supported by Pocket PCs and have a less
good support for rich multimedia files (Raptis et al., 2005).
The main disadvantage of PDAs is the small display that can render difficult the interaction with
the guide and the level of immersion in the proposed multimedia content. This is why Tablet PCs
have also been employed as terminals for the delivery of multimedia guided tours, as was the case
in the Dialogue Museum, in Louvain La Neuve, Belgium and Danae project (Lefftz et al., 2003).
Some of the advantages are the available interaction surface, greater processing and memory
capabilities, while they can be used simultaneously by more than one user. On the contrary, one of
the main disadvantages is that Tablet PCs are much heavier and therefore less practical to carry
even if straps are attached (Figure 2.8c); at the same time the cost is at least double compared to
the cost of a PDA guide. Lately a new type of handy personal computer has made its appearance:
Ultra Mobile PCs or UMPCs. UMPCs are dotted with all the power of Tablet PCs but are
considerably more expensive in comparison with these last, at about 30 to 40%. The main

60

Augmented Reality prototype proposed in this study was delivered in two different types of
UMPCs (Figure 2.8b).

Figure 2.8a-2.8d: Existing alternative (other than PDAs) mobile platforms for the delivery of multimedia guided
visits. From left to right: Use of a mobile phone (Pian et al., 2004), a UMPC (Damala et al., 2008), a laptop
(Lefftz et al., 2003) and a Tablet PC (DANAE project).
A 4th candidate platform is cell phones, which are anyhow converging towards multimedia capable
computers. At least two case studies have used mobiles to deliver context aware information
concerning exhibits. In the city museum of Weimar, mobile phones were used together with a
pattern recognition module by the AR research group of the Bauhaus University (Bruns et al.,
2005). In the United States, an xml-based system was used to convert common mobile phones to
audio guides, as part of a university project (Samis and Pau, 2006). Using a mobile phone as an
audio guide though is not a new idea, as France Telecom RD has been conducting experiments of
that kind from 2002 (Damala et al., 2005). Today a commercialized version of a city guided tour is
available for tourists equipped with mobile phones in Paris. Finally, the delivery of audio
comments on visitors’ self owned mobile phones was experimented by (Nickerson, 2005).

2.3.9 9TH CRITERION: PLATFORM OWNERSHIP

The introduction of highly sophisticated systems as guidance support in the museum premises
comes with a high price. Even admitting that all current challenges discussed in section 2.5 are
addressed, buying or renting, storing, maintaining, distributing and recharging the devices can
cause frustration and difficulty to deal with overheads. This is the reason for which the alternative
of delivering multimedia interpretation material in visitors’ self owned terminals might steadily
gain ground in the future compared to other approaches (Samis, 2007).
The delivery of audio in visitors’ self-owned terminals, like mp3 players or mobile phones, has
already appeared. In this scenario, either the visitor downloads prior to the visit the uploaded on
the museum web site audio commentaries, as for example in the case of San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art (Samis and Pau, 2006) or in the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, or receives via his
mobile phone audio comments once on site (Nickerson, 2005). Concerning the delivery on
visitors’ self-owned cell phones, experimentations with more demanding multimedia content have
also made their appearance. This is the case of Agamemnon project (Figure 2.8a), an outdoor

61

guide for assisting in the visit of Archaeological sites (Pian et al., 2004) and of a project undertaken
by researchers of the Bauhaus university in Weimar who are experimenting with camera equipped
mobile phones and on-device object recognition (Föckler et al., 2005). Not only costs and
expenses could be cut down this way but as visitors have themselves stated, using one’s self
owned terminal might also cut down on the learning curve needed for comprehending how to
interact with a mobile device (Woodruff et al., 2002).
2.4 THE MOBIVISIT PROJECT

2.4.1 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

The Mobivisit project is a combination of an indoor and outdoor portable tourist guide that set as
a goal to examine the continuity of usage of a tourist guide in indoor and outdoor environments.
In this sense the indoor guide, Mobiguide, which at the same time constitutes a mobile multimedia
museum guide, was an extension to the core Mobivisit project, which got finally commercialized
with the form of a tourist guide for the city of Paris. The first experimentations took place in
Lyon, in 2003, on PDAs in order to conduct usability tests regarding the use of the guide in the
city, the surrounding regions as well as in the museum of Fine Arts in Lyon, who was the museum
partner of this project. The museum’s permanent exhibition is comprised of around 3000 objects
exposed in seventy exhibition rooms on three different levels.

2.4.2 PROFILE OF THE MOBILE MUSEUM GUIDE

Applying the nine criteria described in section 2.3 allows the profiling of the mobile museum
guide module implemented in the frame of the “Mobivisit” project. The guide was multimedia
capable, as it featured text, audio, images, and interactive plans of the museum galleries, stitched
together in a Flash application. It used a declarative geolocalization module further described in
section 2.4.5. The experimental module concerning the museum was an offline application,
combined with an online application for the outdoor services. In terms of personalization, the
guide offered the possibility of thematic tours as well as tours according to the time available for
the visit. The social or collaborative character of the visit was not examined separately and no
dedicated modules were designed and implemented. Instead, the focus was on the continuity of
usage in between the indoor and outdoor modules. PDAs were used as delivery platforms for the
indoor, museum guide but for the outdoor guide experiments were also conducted with SPV cell
phones. The possibility for tourists/museum visitors to use their own mobile platform was
another issue that was examined throughout the project.

62

2.4.3 HISTORY OF THE PROJECT AND DESIGN PROCESS

In France Telecom's R&D division, the first investigations in the field of handheld tourist guides
started as early as 2001, through a series of interviews that set as a goal to investigate the type of
services that could be proposed in the tourism domain. Following these interviews, a video
scenario was created, featuring a tourist during an outdoor visit. Several communication functions
were identified through this process and were then included in a storyboard. Based on this
animation, several prototypes were tested, first in the laboratory and then under real conditions.
After the end of the experimentations, France Telecom worked jointly with the French Regional
Tourism Committee of Paris-Ile de France, to develop an experimental Mobivisit for Paris, on a
mobile phone platform (SPV) that would be rented through Tourist Information Offices. Using
the experience gained from the first experimentations, the service was opened to the Orange
Gallery portal and is now operational for a variety of terminals and in many different languages.
As the decision to implement and test a multimedia museum guide was not conceived from the
beginning of the project, three months were only available for the full process of design and
implementation before the first release and the consecutive experiments took place. Despite the
fact that the texts chosen for the guided tour by the museum conservators had been based on
texts created for an audio guide, the full process until the final validation of the content was quite
long. When the content was ready, it had to be translated in English before the recording of the
audio sequences took place. As a general rule, each commented object was accompanied by an
audio commentary of less than three minutes. Apart from the accompanying photo of each
commented work, text was also provided; the available text either reproduced museum objects’
etiquettes or introduced additional to the audio sequences comments. For a total of 40 museum
objects, 60 minutes of audio commentary was available. Subsequently, a FLASH application was
created, described in more detail in the following section. Unlike the outdoor companions of the
guide, the museum application would be stored locally. Despite the fact that the PDA used had
integrated loudspeakers, the audio was delivered through headphones, so that other visitors don’t
get annoyed. The Hewlett Packard PDA used had GPRS capabilities and a memory extension.

2.4.4 DESCRIPTION OF THE GUIDE AND NAVIGATION SCHEME

The introductory scene of the application proposes three options, four if we also count the
possibility of switching the language from French to English and vice versa. The 1st option,
“Concerts in the Garden”, proposes an accompanied by music visit of the museum gardens. The
“Visit the Museum” option opens up a new menu (Figure 2.9), while the “Find the museum”

63

option provides practical way-finding information. Finally the activation of the “headset” button
launches a small audio presentation of the museum building.
Once the “Visit the Museum” option is activated, a new menu comprised of four options is
proposed to the visitor: The “Information for Visitors” offer visitors practical information about
the museum and visiting hours. The “Special Exhibition” section includes information about
temporary exhibitions held in the museum (Figure 2.9).
The options “Plan of the Museum” and “Collections and Visit” propose two alternative ways for
navigation in the main content of the guide. In the first case the visitor can choose between one of
the three annotated plans of the museum (one per floor), create a personalized list choosing
proposed exhibits and proceed with the visit. The commented works will appear on the plan with
the form of grey squares. In the second case the visitor has the possibility to choose between:

Figure 2. 9: Mobivisit project, Screenshots of the mobile museum guide, Museum of Fine Arts, Lyon (Damala et
al., 2005)
-The “Recommended Visit”: This visit comprises all forty exhibits that are included in the tour.
-The option “By Selected Topic”, hosting thematic tours.
-The “Minutes” option: This option gives visitors the possibility to choose a proposed tour, using
as a criterion the available time for the visit. The guide proposes thematic tours of half an hour, an
hour and an hour and a half.
- The “Set Up our Own Visit” option, described above.
Regardless of the way the visitor chooses to proceed with the multimedia tour, the layout of the
information accompanying each exhibit is consistent and follows the same guidelines, so that the
visitors don’t get confused once they have become familiar with the system. Each work included

64

(Figure 2.10) in the visit, is accompanied by a picture that can be zoomed in, an icon showing the
size scale of the exhibit, a text button, when text is available, a headphones button for access to
the audio commentary as well as a forward and back button used for jumping to the next or
previous commented work.
Visitors can also click on the little square above the picture to indicate that they are “done” with
an exhibit (they have seen it). If this action is taken, the museum plan is updated with the already
viewed work of art that gets marked with a cross. On the top of the screen the icons used are the
“Home” button, the “Back” button (return not to the previous commented work but to the
previous screen), the “Geolocalization” button and the “Search” button, that enables the visitor to
search works of art according to three different criteria (type, period, artist). There is also the
“Help” button and a “Close the Application” button. Finally the option “On layout” shows where
exactly the consulted exhibit is located on the map.

Figure 2.10: Mobivisit project, Examples of exhibit presentations (Damala et al., 2005)
2.4.5 GEOLOCALISATION IN MOBIVISIT

Starting with the principle that geolocalization modules provide an invaluable aid in museum
visiting, several technological solutions were considered. The RFID, Infrared and WI-FI
possibilities were ruled out for reasons such as the restrained time frame and the available budget.
The solution had also to be the least invasive concerning the aesthetics of the museum
environment.
Eventually a hybrid solution was proposed: Physically the museum walls were signposted with
special logos indicating the exhibits included in the guide. At the same time, the application itself
proposed two other possibilities. The first one was the “Geolocalization” button which, once
activated, prompted the visitor to fill in a form consisting of three different fields (Figure 2.12).

65

The first field is “View” (e.g. garden, roof and chapel). When the first field was filled in, the list
corresponding to the second field, “exhibit”, was displayed. The same process was repeated for
the third field, named “period”. The visitor then obtained the corresponding floor plan with his
estimated position given in a flashing square. A second element of the guide assisting visitors in
geolocalization was the option “Plan of the Museum”, which we already met in the 2nd level
navigation of the application. When this option is activated a new screen appears, presenting the
three different exhibition levels (Figure 2.12b). The visitor is then expected to choose one of the
floors. When this happens, a plan of the selected floor appears on the screen. Gray squares
indicate the exhibits, included in the multimedia tour, while it is possible to zoom on the map.
This form of visiting requires the visitor's ability to decode the plan and understand to which
section of the plan that he/she sees corresponds. For this reason additional signposting was used,
indicating which of the works exhibited are included in the multimedia tour.

Figure 2.11: Mobivisit project, Navigation flowchart
2.4.6 TESTING AND EVALUATION OF THE GUIDE

During the first three months of the experimentations, approximately 500 tourists borrowed the
multimedia guide from the main Lyon Tourist Information Office to test it free of charge, for a
period of one to three days. A second experimentation took place in the museum, with three
different target groups: tourists, students and “Friends of the Museum”, namely senior citizen
visitors. In order to test the effectiveness of both the indoor and the outdoor multimedia guide,
both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods were used. Quantitative evaluation included

66

surveys and logging visitors actions, while for the qualitative evaluation, visitor’s observations were
combined with interviews (Le Coq et al., 2003).
From these 500 visitors, 232 visitors filled in and handed back the survey concerning the use of
the guide. According to the logs obtained for these users, the average museum visiting time was
about 40 minutes. One of the features most appreciated by the visitors was the possibility given
to organize the multimedia tour according to their available time. The possibility to undertake
thematic visits was also highly appreciated. On the contrary, many visitors expressed their
frustration for finding out that several works were not present as a result of a loan or restoration.
Some of the less used provided features were the “Help” function, the “Search” function and the
“Mark as seen” function.

Figure 2.12: Mobivisit project, the fill-in form used for geolocalization and snapshots of the interactive museum plan
(Damala et al., 2005)
Another group which consisted of 93 visitors was observed during their museum visit and was
then asked to fill in the same survey as the aforementioned group. The observation data was then
combined with the data logs, as well as with the questionnaires filled in. The average time this
group spent with the guide was 50 minutes and the average number of audio sequences heard was
41. The “recommended visit” was chosen by 57% of the participants. 25% chose to use the
“Minutes” visit, (visit according to the time available). 25% of them personalized their visit while
only 3% used the proposed thematic visits.
Finally, observation and in depth interviews were conducted with 35 “Friends of the Museum”
visitors, that were tourists, students or seniors. The interviews were transcribed and examined
individually and in correlation. This group of visitors, presumably because of their particular
interest in art, spent an average of 2 hours in the museum using the “Recommended Visit” option
that includes all exhibits. The average duration of the audio comments heard was about 60
minutes. This is a very interesting finding as it might be an indication that this group of visitors

67

also contemplated during their visit not-included in the guide works of art. Despite a 5-minute
demonstration, some of the visitors, mainly senior citizens, had some difficulties in understanding
how to use the guide. All participants mentioned the geolocalization module but not always in a
positive way. Some of them stressed out that they did not arrive to easily identify the objects
included in the guide on the plan. It is maybe for this reason that the majority of visitors
mentioned using simply the photos of the works in the guide and the museum signposting as a
mean for orientation. As to the quality and length of the audio commentaries, many participants
pointed their approval for the use of both male and female voices. The “text” feature on the other
hand, was not considered to be helpful when it just reproduced the museum label text, but only
when it contained information going beyond the audio commentaries. The majority of the
interviewed visitors mentioned that they liked the graphical user interface (GUI). Finally 9 out of
35 participants expressed their wish to see a strap attached to the Pocket PC so as to free their
hands and protect the terminal from accidents.

2.4.7 LESSONS LEARNED AND ISSUES DETECTED

Mobivisit is a project that put under questioning, the continuity of usage from outdoor tourist
guides to indoor - content and context specific - handheld guides. However the life cycle of the
project and the evaluation undertaken after the completion of the projects provides some useful
hints concerning the techniques of creation and implementation of a mobile multimedia
interpretation medium for the museum environment. This issue will be also further examined in
the dedicated 2.5 section, where barriers to overcome are examined.
Geolocalization: Despite the care taken, it seems that in terms of geolocalization more progress
and innovation is necessary. Most of the visitors interviewed criticized with one or the other way
the performance of the geolocalization modules. It is worth noticing here, that even most of the
“Friends of the Museum” visitors though more familiar with the museum premises preferred the
photographs over deciphering the interactive museum plan as a navigation aid.
An Interdisciplinary collaboration: As with other projects an interdisciplinary collaboration was
needed. As mobile museum guides are still far from being the norm in museums, museum
partners are often not completely aware of the palette of the possible functions or utilities this new
medium possesses. Ironically what is also true is that museum multimedia guides can be as various
and diverse as museums and museum displays are. In the case of Mobivisit project, the time
needed for the internal (museum) validation of the presentation content and the scenario, was
disproportionately long compared with the total duration of the museum project.

68

Human resources and management issues (logistics): Several important remarks are related
with the issue of the distribution of the guides. More in particular, the museum employees on-site
were quite reluctant in assuming responsibility regarding the distribution of the guides, recharging
the batteries etc. This was less of a denial and more a particular stress as to the possibility of doing
something inappropriate that would damage the devices. This provides an additional reason for
exploring the possibility of use of visitors’ self-owned platforms. Not only the cost could be
considerably lower, but fewer personnel would be needed, while visitors would presumably be
more at ease using their own terminal. Human resources issues were also one of the reasons for
which the project of the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon was discontinued.
Costs: From the full design and implementation process, it became apparent that appropriate
financial resources are compulsory. Mobile multimedia guides in the museum setting are not
“money makers” and apart from costs regarding the design and implementation phases,
investment is also necessary for buying the terminals, maintaining the system and updating the
content. In terms of visitor support additional personnel is needed to hand out the guides, explain
their use and recharge them. In the case of the museum of Fine Arts in Lyon, this was a detail that
became apparent as soon as the application was ready to be tested by real visitors. The already
existing personnel was hesitant as to whether it could be of any assistance and eventually was not
at all implicated in the experimentations.
Evaluation: A methodological and data integrity issue arouse after the beginning of the
experimentations. As already explained the system logged visitors’ actions for evaluation purposes.
However, it soon became apparent that as visitors borrowed the guide from the tourist
information office for a period of 1 to 3 days, there was no easy way to tell whether the log files
obtained corresponded to a museum visit or to an off-site consultation. Methodological issues
regarding the evaluation of mobile museum guide projects are examined in detail in Chapter 5.
Personalization: The comparison of the visiting patterns among the “Friends of the Museum”
group and the other participants showed that different visitor profiles demonstrate different
wishes and needs, regarding the duration of the visit and the level of detail demanded by the
accompanying information. In the case of the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon the average visit time
for the “Friends of the Museum” was two hours, as in contrast with the 45 minutes in average
spent by the rest of the participants. The fact that the total duration of the content of the guide
was around 60 minutes, demonstrates that the “Friends of the Museum” group also contemplated
objects not included in the multimedia guide.

69

Continuity of Usage: As the investigation concerning the continuity of usage between outdoor
and indoor applications continues, it becomes more and more apparent, that special attention
should be paid to the design and implementation of more generic interfaces and solutions. In the
future, this could allow the users to use their own platform, decreasing the costs dramatically. At
the same time a better continuity of usage could be established, combining for example, indoor,
outdoor and home usage. In this scenario the application presented on the mobile phone or
Pocket PC, could be linked to the museum web site content, and could possibly be consulted from
home thus encouraging a long lasting relationship between the museum and its visitors.
However the possibility to create a generic system for all museums is still an open question as each
museum is unique not only in character and nature but also in policies, human resources, available
funds etc. A standardization process would ideally regroup all interested members of the involved
communities, including museums, IT companies, and governmental bodies. And while
standardization for museum documentation purposes is already on the way (CIDOC, 2006),
standardization for museum educational applications on handheld platforms has never – to our
knowledge- been considered.
The creation of a generic system would also allow museum staff to keep the multimedia guide
content up to date, and museum visitors to communicate with friends inside or outside the
museum. The navigation should be as easy as that of a mobile phone, while financial contribution
for the provided services could take the form of a subscription to the specific service. In order to
roughly summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each solution, the following table (Table
2.1) was dressed.

2.5 THE DANAE PROJECT

2.5.1 SCOPE AND HISTORY OF THE PROJECT

DANAE (Dynamic and distributed Adaptation of scalable multimedia coNtent in a context Aware
Environment) is a concluded IST European co-funded project that ran from January 2004 to June
2006 with a goal to specify, develop, integrate and validate a complete framework for the delivery
of rich multimedia content to a variety of end-devices and with a minimal cost to the end-user. A
total of 11 partners participated in the project which counted considerable contributions in the
domain of the MPEG4 and MPEG 21 standards (DANAE, May 3, 2006). All technological bricks
developed were more or less successfully integrated in a mobile multimedia guide created for
Museon museum in Den Hague, Netherlands. The following sections explain in detail how these
technological innovations may in the future influence the functions and possibilities provided by
mobile museum guides.
The author had the possibility to participate in the process of the conceptual and interaction
design of the guide, from October 2004 and until the end of the project. A first important remark
is that the cutting-edge, technology-oriented character of the project seemed to overshadow the
actual requirements analysis phase that the particularity of the selected museum environment
imposed. This does not mean that scenarios and innovative uses were not conceived and then
implemented but rather that often enough these scenarios had, somehow, to seriously take under
consideration how to incorporate an already under implementation module in the museum
application. Therefore, the first action undertaken by the author was to establish a communication
channel with the only museum representative and define the profile of the museum in which this
intervention would take place.

2.5.2 MUSEON HISTORY AND PROFILE

Museon museum was founded in 1904 as a private organisation. In 1920 it became public and was
taken over by the municipality. Nowadays it has taken the form of a non-profit private foundation
supported mainly by the local municipality (municipality of The Hague). The Museon’s collection
consists of about 250,000 objects, 85 000 of which are digitally documented using “The Museum
System” (Gallery Systems) commercial software used for museum documentation.
The museum has a very strong educational orientation, which largely defines many of the activities
undertaken. In temporary and permanent exhibitions, the exhibits are mainly chosen for their
educational value. The museum also encourages all kind of interpretation activities and even

71

“dares” to involve visitors in a public dialogue around objects and ideas through the use of
interactives such as polling systems. Apart from the multimedia guide other media used to reveal
the narrative apart the exhibits themselves are panels, text labels, printed material, and multimedia
applications ranging from videos to interactive collaborative games etc (Figure 2.13).
The museum has a web site constructed by an external, private company and maintained internally
(www.museon.nl). Press releases are published periodically. The museum also maintains a close
relation with its volunteers and members of the Association of Museon Friends. Some guided
visits are given by volunteers, while the museum shop is mainly functioning with volunteers. The
predominant profile among Museon visitors are parents or grandparents with children and school
groups, though of course other profiles are also largely represented.
DANAE project coincided with the museum renovation of the permanent and semi-permanent
exhibition spaces. The new exhibition space, for which the guide would be designed, would be
comprised by 1000 m2 of unified exhibition space, surrounded by eighteen 100 m2 spaces. In these
new exhibitions the multidisciplinary and educational character of the Museon is fully expressed.
Around 90 terminals with interactive multimedia content would be also installed in the exhibition
area (Figure 2.13). The content of these multimedia kiosks ranges from arcade games to video and
slideshows that can be consulted in combination with MuseOnline, a system that, upon
registration, uses bar codes to identify different visitors, keep a track of their visit and save the
data for later consultation via the World Wide Web, creating a unique web page for each visitor.
In this already well-thought and rich in interpretation resources environment which could be the
added value of a mobile multimedia guide? According to the principal museum representative,
Hub Kockelkorn, some key characteristics and advantages of a mobile multimedia guide over
more traditional methods (text commentaries, paper books, audio guides, docents, information
kiosks, other stationary multimedia installations etc) are the greatest capability for content
personalization, the possibility to potentially deliver unlimited information to the visitors, and
taking a step forward from the classical audio guides. As we will see later on in case study of the
museum of Fine Arts in Rennes (Chapter 4, 5 ,6, 7), Museon believed that the new guide might
attract new visitors and help the museum in establishing a long-lasting relationship with the
visitors, by intriguing imagination, facilitating learning, and encouraging public dialogue around
exposed objects.

72

Figure 2.13: Interactives used in the permanent “Your World, my world exhibition”, Museon museum,
Netherlands.
For Museon, the ideal mobile companion should be something between an e-docent and a virtual
guide, allowing the visitor to “dig-in” the content according to his wishes and needs. As is the case
with other museums, the question of whether there would be “potential competition between the
actual exposed objects and the guidebook” also constituted an issue to be examined. Concerning
the number of available terminals that would be necessary in case the guide was adopted for real
use in the museum, an estimated number of 30 to 40 terminals would be needed.

2.5.3 ARCHITECTURE OF THE MULTIMEDIA APPLICATION

The goal of the DANAE project was to design a platform for context-aware dynamic multimedia
content adaptation. The content was defined in terms of interactive scenes of the museum
multimedia guide that would allow the visitors to navigate in a potentially complex page-hierarchy,
mixing text, avatars, audio, video and still images. “Context”, for the project purposes, was defined
as visitor’s location in the museum, preferences, terminal capabilities (e.g. PDA, tablet PC,
projection screen) and allocation of network bandwidth according to the number of other sessions
run by other visitors, equipped with other kind of terminals (Figure 2.14).
The adaptation involves a client (located at the end-user terminal) which collects the user context
and requests multimedia scenes. All adaptation decisions and actions are taken by the server which
is able to modify the way content is presented by changing the layout, the type of media and their
bitrates. For instance, a scene adapted for a PC will have a horizontal layout including large
portions of text and high bit rate video. The same scene adapted for a PDA will have a vertical
layout with audio instead of text and low bit rate video.
When the player requests from the server a specific multimedia content, an MPEG-21 based
representation of this content is used to compute the best adaptation according to the data stored
in the context repository. The “Optimizer”, a key module inside the adaptation architecture, will
first select the right media according to the user preferences (like audio vs. text), terminal
capability (like available codecs or video size matching the devices) and available network

73

bandwidth. Once the adaptation decision is made, the “Optimizer” creates and sets up the media
adapters corresponding to each stream being adapted. Then the media delivery from server to
multimedia player can start.

During the session, the context may vary over time: the network characteristics or the player
performances may decrease or increase (for instance the number of visitors connected to an access
point may limit the available bandwidth). This will induce a context modification at the client side
which will forward this information to the server via the context repository. This information can
be used to re-allocate a new bandwidth to each media by modifying the relevant media adapters’
settings. Further, if the changes are drastic enough, the Optimizer may compute a new layout with
eventually new media.

2.5.4 A POSSIBLE USE SCENARIO

The following scenario was one of the initial inputs for the application specification and design,
conceived by the museum representative. As we will see, not all of the functionalities were
implemented. Nevertheless, by reproducing here the initial scenario we are able to understand in
which ways the mobile guide could be integrated in the museum.
“Hans and Iris Jansens and their two children Anna and Nicolaas arrive all together in front of the new Museon
exhibition entrance desk where several assistants are waiting for. One assistant invites the family to come closely. He
starts explaining the different themes of the new exhibition. He also proposes them to use new mobile guide devices
that will help them to have a complete and full experience of the exhibition and to dig interactively as far as they
want into thematic, specific creations, history and usage of exposed objects. Fully convinced, the Jansens family agree

74

to use those new devices. Iris and Hans decide to get a PC tablet while Anna and Nicolaas take a PDA-like
device.
Before entering the new exhibition, the assistant advises the family to take few minutes to first register by completing
the first form (name, age, language) and to make some choice according to what they want (thematic, time to visit,
knowledge level etc). Then, they start listening carefully the introduction presentation that explains how to use their
device. Anna and Nicolaas are very amused by the funny 3D character that appears in order to explain some points
more in details. Guided by their mobile device, the family starts walking towards the “everything changes” theme
space. As soon as they arrive close to the targeted space, their mobile guide pops up summary information and a map
of the room. Then, each member of the family is discovering topics at their own pace.
They quickly realize that the mobile device is much more than a classical audio guide. Indeed, it allows to dig into
subjects by showing movies that can be paused, forwarded etc, to come back to the main menu and get complementary
desired information, to ask questions to the expert 3D character. Moreover, popup windows ask them to express
what they like (creation, topics and other things).
Anna and Nicolaas move faster than their parents through the new exhibition and they are discovering by
themselves new space. They understand easily how to use the mobile guide and take pleasure in navigating into the
mobile applications which is full of funny and interesting information (movies, texts, and explanations from the 3D
character, panoramic pictures of some situation or place).
Iris and Hans are very impressed by the different functionalities offered by the mobile device. One of them seems
magical. Indeed, arriving in front of a wall panel showing information about specific past civilizations, they realize
that their mobile device automatically shows the same information and movies on their own tablet. Moreover, they
are able to transfer the videos they are watching on their terminals to the much larger panels, enjoying thus a better
quality in image and sound. They can also transfer multimedia content playing on the stationary multimedia kiosks
on their terminal, so as to watch them privately using the functionality of session mobility (Figure 2.15a).
Suddenly, Iris wonders where Anna and Nicolaas are. Hans reassures her by showing her the museum map and the
interesting functionality “localize your buddies”. Immediately, they know that Anna and Nicolaas are already at
the museum store. Very happy of their visit, Iris and Hans catch up with Anna and Nicolaas at the store. Their
children run at them and ask them to go to the media postcard room just next to the store. The media room allows
several people to realize their own video or photo postcard with the topic they want. Nicolaas wants absolutely to
choose a video sequence of a T-Rex dinosaur running at them. So, they all act to as if they are very afraid during the
10 seconds of the sequence. Then, the 3D character explains that the video postcard is available through the web site
of the museum. A specific access number will be given to them at the exit when they will give back the mobile devices.

75

Very amused, the family walks back through the store. Iris and Hans realize their tablet PC starts presenting a
consistent summary of their visit: what they saw, what they liked the most. Then, the 3D character appears and
invites them to have a look on to specific books, DVD, postcards or T-shirt they may like according to the content
they consulted during their visit.
Back home, Nicolaas insists to go at once onto the museum website to see (and download) the terrible sequence they
did with the T-Rex. Everybody laughs so much when they see the T-Rex sequence. Just after that, Hans realizes the
website is full of interesting information. It’s possible to get summary information from their last visit, to watch on a
map the path each of them followed in the museum exhibition, to have access to all of the museum shop items and to
buy them on line. Moreover, the website presents future activities of the museum (new rooms, next exhibition) and
also gives access to live conferences with world experts on specific subjects. Already amazed, Hans discovers the
fantastic virtual tour of the museum (panoramic pictures and videos full of interactive hyperlinks to other contents).”
The initial stage of the project had foreseen the creation of content for two different target
groups, children under 12 year old or adolescents and adults, in two languages, Dutch and English.
Eventually however, only one tour was possible to be implemented, suited to adults.

the left the original design by Jean-Marie Boomputte, to the right two screen shots of the 3D-rendered avatar)
2.5.5 CONTENT STRUCTURE, APPLICATION DESIGN AND NAVIGATION

The interface of the application as well as the navigation schemes were largely influenced and
inspired by the study of the new exhibition space. The exhibition, entitled “Your World, My
World” would be comprised by 12 different themes treating the story of human development
under many different aspects, from the first appearance of life on earth to world religions and
energy forms. Each of these themes would be further decomposed in different sub-themes.
Therefore, all included objects would belong to a main theme and most of the times also to a subtheme. The interface and navigation scheme eventually chosen, reflected the physical but also
contextual exhibition organization so as to render the exhibition narrative clearer but also so as to
create bonds between the physical and digital displays. An avatar, designed by the Belgian artist

76

Boomputte (Figure 2.15b), would provide an introduction for every theme and subtheme (Figure
2.16).
As with most museum exhibitions, Museon’s exhibition could not be considered as a collection of
single objects. The majority of the objects on display serve primarily for the illustration of a story
that unfolds through the interrelationships of the objects on display. In the exhibition, selected
chapters from the history of Earth to Mankind would be presented, focusing on topics like
geological processes, evolution, oceans and wetlands, evolution of man, archaeology, energy,
warfare, religion and the creativity of mankind. The eighteen separate spaces are used to enter into
selected separate aspects of the story narrated in the main exhibition (Figure 2.17a).
The above graph demonstrated how the navigation pattern emerged by examining the structure of
the exhibition. It depicts the underlying structure of one of the exhibition’s themes, dedicated to
birds and mammals. This theme is divided in different sub-themes or narratives. In the exhibition
space, these narratives are expressed by a group of objects serving as visual statements. In the
same way, the guide’s interface reflects this structure. Each theme is divided in sub-themes. Each
sub-theme proposes additional information for selected exhibits. The information may have the
form of text, audio, video, image, animation or a combination of these elements.

Figure 2.16: DANAE project, the content representation graph

77

For every theme an introduction is proposed, and then the different themes with their respective
introductions follow, before the visitor finally reaches the object level. This proposed by the
author structure is also reflected on the interface design for a tablet PC, shown in figure 17b. To
the right part of the screen, we see in form of tabs, the different themes available on the guide.
Each time a visitor enters a new theme, the Wi-Fi system communicates with the terminal. A
white circle starts flashing to indicate that new content is available and waits to be activated by the
visitor. On the top right of the screen, we see the map application that can be used to locate other
companions, registered during the registration process simultaneously.

2.5.6 CONTENT AUTHORING FOR MUSEON’S MOBILE GUIDE

The content creation in DANAE was based on an XML format that describes the layout and
styling of the multimedia scene, the embedding of media components as well as the interaction.
Among the media components defined in this language, one can count text, audio, images, video
but also panoramic images and slideshows. The XML document and all the necessary resources
for rendering the scene are then compiled in a binary MPEG-4 representation for the delivery on
the mobile device. The benefits of this approach were that high-level constructs are used in a
manner close to HTML authoring which is well-known to many authors and that MPEG specifics
are hidden from the authoring process. For audio and video, only one encoding for each audio
and video resource is necessary. The MPEG-21 metadata also defined in the project makes the
server dynamically extract the audio and video adapted to the available bandwidth and display size.

2.5.7 PROPOSING AN EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

Evaluation with real visitors was planned in the case of DANAE and took the form of a separate
deliverable, examining all possible methodological solutions and approaches, together with their
advantages and disadvantages. Apart from designating appropriate for the evaluation of the guide
methods, the work carried out strived to better approach and comprehend the meaning of
effectiveness regarding relevant mobile guides in the museum setting, which is often the only
common point shared in evaluation studies. Unfortunately the evaluation itself was finally not
realized due to the tight budget and the time constraints regarding the completion of the project.
However and even though evaluation was finally not possible to be carried out, the review of
related literature and practices resulted in a taxonomy regarding evaluation issues that may arise
during the deployment of a mobile museum guide project. The proposed taxonomy as well as
methodological considerations regarding evaluation for mobile guides in the museum setting are
examined in depth in the 5th chapter.

created for the TabletPC delivery (B) (Brelot et al., 2005)
2.5.8 LESSONS LEARNED AND ISSUES DETECTED

Despite the fact that the DANAE project was mainly focused on strategies for delivering rich
multimedia content in a large variety of platforms and devices, several of the issues that came
forth during the design and implementation of the guide, are closely related with general issues
that may arise during the process of design and creation of mobile guides for the museum
environment.
Geolocalization: The use of Wi-Fi was successful enough to give the visitors their position with a
granularity of about 1,5 to 2 meters. Taking under consideration the overall layout of the
exhibition, composed of themes and corresponding subthemes, these results can be considered
encouraging and quite helpful in case a visitor wants a rough idea regarding the theme area in
which he/she is found. However, as with Mobivisit project, the system was less helpful regarding
orientation and physical navigation at a museum-object level.
Costs: In order to achieve the 1,5 to 2 meters granularity, a fully functional wireless system had to
be placed in the museum. Unlike the first estimations regarding the number of Wi-Fi access
points, the number in reality had to be doubled. Museum representatives were also quite skeptical

79

about the costs for buying or renting the devices, charging them, maintaining them and providing
personnel to assist visitors with information regarding their use.
Interdisciplinary collaboration: The interdisciplinary team involved and the size of this 11partners project was quite disproportionate in comparison with the work-hours needed for the
final application content authoring and creation. A wealth of “rough” material was available from
the educational department of the museum, but for the creation of scenarios and the conversion
of the “source” material to a multimedia application, it was necessary to join forces with the
museum curator that was also the museum representative. Despite the use of XML for authoring
the content, the full process was very long. At the same time, the technical orientation of the
project from the very beginning demanded only some demonstration content to be created,
therefore not pushing further than the strictly necessary minimum the content creation of the
guide.
Personalization: Personalization features were another point that was not able to be treated in all
aspects. All proposed features regarding the low cost delivery and adaptation of multimedia
content in several platforms were realized, but it was not possible to advance more, for example,
by experimenting with different interfaces or content for different visitor profiles. However, even
so, some of the ideas proposed by DANAE, like the session mobility, giving the visitor the
possibility to transfer his PDA or TabletPC session on another, larger display, can be considered
unique and pioneering in the field.
Evaluation: The author cannot but regret the fact that eventually it was not possible to
experiment with the guide in the museum, under real conditions. However the research carried out
regarding this phase of the project gave a first classification of evaluation points to be considered
for museum guides projects and also a methodological framework which was a source of
inspiration for the planning of the evaluation of the Augmented Reality mobile museum guide
prototype proposed for the museum of Fine Arts in Rennes (Chapter 4, 5, 6).
2.6 BARRIERS TO OVERCOME AND OPEN ISSUES

If mobile museum guides offer a great potential, why then just few museums are currently able to
propose a complete offer with mobile, multimedia and interactive handheld companions? Even if
the will to adopt new technologies is taken for granted, museums have to face some issues and
barriers which are mainly technological but also human and economical.

80

2.6.1 HUMAN AND ECONOMICAL BARRIERS

The adoption of new multimedia handheld devices for the guidance of museum visitors brings
museums in a position of facing many "human" related issues. The major one is that every
museum is unique and special in character; therefore it is quite difficult to come up with a generic
technical multimedia solution. Apparently this raises the total cost for the creation and updating of
the multimedia guide, which is often one of the main reasons that handheld multimedia guides are
not yet omnipresent in museums. As a consequence, a lot of decision-making is requested in such
projects: How to implement an application which should absolutely not compete with the current
exhibition but supplement it? How to allow a visitor to dig deeply into a subject without losing the
narrative of the exhibition? In this sense, a significant amount of work is needed to select relevant
contents (text, image, video, speech) from the museum database, to rewrite/reproduce some text
or audio contents, to structure them and finally to insert them into an harmonious application that
allows to keep the story and the philosophy of the exhibition.
Another very important issue is that the creation of such resources demands an interdisciplinary
approach and collaboration that is not always easy to cope with. Certainly, cultural heritage related
applications are becoming more and more popular as showcases for many cutting-edgetechnology computer applications, but as marked by F. Nicolucci, “in the hands of technicians, computer
graphics applications to material cultural heritage may quickly turn into unfair treatment of information”
(Nicolucci, 2005). Therefore it is a good starting point to gather together people with different
abilities, in our case museum curators, museum educators, ergonomists, interaction designers and
engineers. However, turning them into a cohesive and efficient team can be a separate challenge
(Greene and Sharon, 2000).
On another level, museums have to face economical barriers due to the cost of the deployment of
such a system. They need to acquire new devices through buying or rental, store them, maintain
and distribute them. The museum IT infrastructure may necessitate interventions among which
the stitching of the new application with pre-existing systems (like a web site, stationary PC
platform, current tour). Finding a business model is also crucial so as to at least balance the cost of
the investment keeping in mind that what is quite advanced today might be rather outdated
tomorrow.
To the human barriers one should also mention the reluctance or suspicion that sometimes is
provoked by the nature of the intervention. From the museum professionals' point of view,
multimedia museum guides must not compete with the actual works of art, neither interfere in the
“dialogue” between a museum visitor and a work of art, or distract visitors’ attention from it (von

81

Lehn and Heath, 2003). Though some of these issues are also true for classical audio tours, the
“gadget” character of this new media provokes more reactions.
As a museum curator in Tate Modern declared:
“We are obviously not trying to create mini-television programs that people are watching as they
go through the galleries.” (Haithman, 2005)

2.6.2 TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS

Powerful, multimedia-capable, wirelessly connected and portable, the new generation multimedia
handheld devices appear to be the new "grail" for museums in order to assist visitors with the visit
and ease the interpretation. Multimodal applications can be tailored to fit specific visitors’ needs,
contextual services can be provided dynamically while potentially unlimited content can be
delivered to visitors’ terminals.
However, in addition to previously mentioned human and economical issues, museums have to
face also some technical issues, mainly linked to content creation, context awareness,
geolocalization and content delivery.
Content creation is one of the most important issues. As soon as all elementary media (text, video,
audio, pictures) have been selected and gathered in a coherent manner, the application itself needs
to be implemented. A manual implementation page by page is only feasible for experiments with
limited amount of data. When the content of the future multimedia guide becomes very large, the
system should be able to retrieve directly the content from the museum’s database, making it
easier to keep it up-to-date. Next to this automatic system, other tools are needed to be able to
produce a coherent story (with a 3D avatar for example) and to well gather the different objects
and themes into a full-fledged scenario. The scenario itself should be well balanced so that the
mobile guide corresponds to visitors' main usage: getting the maximum of information easily, in a
minimum amount of time.
As many prerequisite modules for mobile museum guides are strongly linked with the choice of a
particular platform we might deduce, that if in the future the market’s evolution allows visitors to
use their own terminals, Pocket PCs or mobile phones, the cost could decrease dramatically and a
better continuity of usage could be established, combining for example, indoor, outdoor and
home usage. Ideally this kind of solution would also allow the museum staff to keep the
multimedia guide content up to date, as well as the visitors to communicate with friends inside or

82

outside the museum. Navigation should be as easy as with mobile phones, while the financial
contribution for the provided services could take the form of a subscription to the specific service.
Delivery of the content appears to be the next important issue museums need to address. How to
deliver the content to the mobile device when the visitor is asking for it? The first obvious
solution is to store all content locally into the device which solves at the same time all delivery
issues. As we have already seen this solution has been adopted in many experimentations.
However, despite the constant increase of the memory capacity of portable devices, the size
needed to store all possible scenarios, originating from different contextual parameters, with all
audio and video clips, often turns out to be extremely large. The second main drawback in storing
the full content locally is that all devices have to be updated as often as the scenario content is
updated. To deliver the content through a wireless connection is the second alternative. The
current explosion of wireless network (e.g. 3G, GPRS, Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, Bluetooth) offers a set of
off-the-shelf solutions that can answer these needs. Wireless technologies and networks tempt also
to resolve the very important issue of visitor navigation in the physical space of the museum as
well as in its digital application counterpart, which is an issue raised regardless of other important
decisions that have to be made. The impact of this decision can be enormous on other candidate
modules regarding for example assistance of the visitor in his intellectual and physical way-finding
activities, content delivery, communication and interaction. In parallel, the implementation of
geolocalization solutions should be in accordance with the general aesthetics of the museum
exhibition.
Despite all other remarkable advances in mobile applications geolocalization issues, orientation in
indoor spaces remains an open question. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have been employed in the museum
context for geolocalization but are inappropriate for educated guesses about orientation, while
RFID and Infrared have also been tested but mostly in a trigger-like manner for delivering or
bookmarking appropriate multimedia content [17]. In addition, unlike Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, RFID
and Infrared require line-of-sight, difficult to achieve in the sometimes heavily crowded museum
spaces. This is why, often enough the interface of mobile museum guides uses visual cues, usually
pictures of commented exhibits, to help the visitor to identify artworks and orientate himself in
the museum space (Getty, 2005).

83

2.7 DISCUSSION

This chapter aimed to examine the role and the potential of mobile guides in the museum setting.
Mobile museum guides are not just a recent new-age gadget but an interpretation medium
alongside with other media used in the museum environment in order to assist museum visitors
throughout a visit. As at the same time, they appertain to other IT used in the museum context for
purposes ranging from interpretation to documentation and administration, they may serve as a
platform onto which a variety of applications can be delivered.
In order to provide a picture of the actual state of the art regarding the use of mobile guides in the
museum, nine criteria of classification were discussed. Using the criteria provided allows for the
creation of a “profile” of mobile museum guides while it also reveals possible principal functional
requirements residing in every mobile museum guide project. The nine criteria are: the media
employed, geolocalization capabilities, personalization, continuity of usage of the proposed
multimedia application, taking under consideration the social context of the visit, continuity of
usage of the proposed application, modules expanded to include the pre- and post-visit phase,
inclusion of edutainment activities, delivery-platform ownership and type and local or remote
media storage. The discussion of each of these nine criteria combined with illustrative examples
from mobile museum guides projects gave also a picture of the current state of the art in this field.
In order to further elucidate the criteria proposed, but also in order to demonstrate other issues
that may arise during the full life circle of a mobile museum guide, two mobile museum guides
projects in which the author participated, Mobivisit and DANAE, were presented in more detail.
Despite the differences in the conception of these two projects regarding the time frame, the
involved stakeholders and the type of application eventually created, some resemblances also
emerged. In a more abstract level the resemblances can be linked with the topic of human,
economical and technological barriers also discussed in this chapter.
In a more specific level, two important issues emerged. The first one is related with the delivery
platforms to be used for the delivery of the museum guide’s application. Currently, the most
common platforms used in related projects are PDAs. Though the Mobivisit project delivered the
museum application for the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon on PDAs, it also explored the
possibility, as well as the advantages and disadvantages, of using self-owned terminals, like for
example, mobile phones. DANAE also examined this possibility. This is partly due to the fact that
the interaction surface of PDAs is small and susceptible to cause problems regarding selection,

84

navigation and manipulation of objects. This was one of the reasons for which DANAE also
experimented with other type of platforms, like Tablet PCs.
The second common point of importance was related with the geolocalization issue. As is the case
with other museum interpretation media (paper books, audio guides, text), a visitor needs to know
how to correlate the pieces of provided information or interpretation material with the museum
objects on display. As geolocalization constitutes one of the nine criteria we introduced for the
classification of related projects, we also had the possibility to see the different ways this issue can
be addressed. Mobivisit used declarative geolocalization, while DANAE used the Wi-Fi
technology in order to address this problem. Other methods include the use of Infrared and RFID
technologies. All of these methods demonstrate advantages and disadvantages that need to be
taken under consideration with regards to the mechanisms provided by each approach in order to
assist a visitor in creating correlations between the computer application and the real, surrounding
environment. In addition, once the technique of establishing correlations has been mastered by
museum visitors, they then also need to learn how to “locate” themselves in the interactive
application and how to interact with it.
Under this perspective, the issue of geolocalization seems to be very strongly linked with the issue
of interaction. However, geolocalization is not the only influential parameter regarding the
complex issue of human computer interaction with mobile museum guides in the museum
environment. This is exactly the reason for which the issue of interaction with a mobile device
during the museum visit has not been brought up, up till now. In the next chapter, having already
familiarized ourselves with the main challenges related with the introduction and use of mobile
guides in the museum, we will examine closer the issue of interaction and we will argue that the
use of Augmented Reality as a principal component for geolocalization, orientation, and
navigation could greatly facilitate interaction both with a mobile museum guide application as well
as with the museum objects on display.

85

CHAPTER 3
INTRODUCING AUGMENTED REALITY FOR MOBILE
MULTIMEDIA MUSEUM GUIDES

3.1 INTRODUCTION

In the previous chapter the most influential mobile museum guides projects were presented and a
series of criteria for facilitating their classification were introduced and discussed. Our approach
demonstrated that each mobile museum guide application is unique and its lifecycle involves a
long series of decisions that finally shape the end result.
In this chapter we will examine closer the context of interaction regarding the use of mobile
multimedia guides in the museum environment and we will argue that the use of Augmented
Reality (AR) could provide an interesting alternative for orientation, navigation and interaction
both in the physical (the museum) and the digital (the type of mobile multimedia application
examined) context.
The chapter is not intended to provide an exhaustive overview of the numerous technicalities
involved in setting up an AR system, a subject that anyhow draws the attention of a constantly
exponential number of engineers around the world. It rather aims, first, to examine the existent
uses of mobile AR applications and second, to highlight the affinities between AR and
“Intelligent” Cultural Heritage applications.

3.2 INTERACTION WITH MOBILE GUIDES IN THE MUSEUM SETTING

Interaction is a key issue and component of any high or low-level computer application. Though
the term “interaction” figured already several times in the influential article “Man-Computer
Symbiosis” by J. Licklider, published in 1960 (Licklider, 1960), interaction design started to
preoccupy the scientific community not earlier than the late ‘80s (Norman, 1988).

86

Several years had to pass by before the notion of interaction became popular to the wide public, as
illustrated by the 1993 version of the Collins English Language Dictionary. Despite the fact that
the verb “interact” is defined as a situation in which “…two things react together in the same situation, so
that they effect each other’s development or condition”, the entry “interactive use of a computer” is still
strictly defined as a situation where “the user and the computer communicate directly with each other via a
keyboard and a screen, rather than the user just putting in programs to be run”. In 2001, Dix et al. (Dix et al.,
2001) define interaction as “a communication between a user and a computer in order to accomplish
something…”, and where the “user” can be a single user or a group of users who is “trying to get the
job done using the technology” and by “computer”, “any technology ranging from the general desktop computer to a
large scale computer system, a process control system or an embedded system”. Similarly, a 2005 definition from
Love (Love, 2005) defines mobile human computer interaction (MHCI) as the “relationship between
people, mobile computer systems and applications that they use on a daily basis”. The importance of treating
aspects related with interaction and interaction design is also reflected on recent systematic
attempts to employ schools of philosophical thought in order to tackle not only the meaning but
also the action-space (or problem-space) of human-computer interaction (HCI). This is, for
example, the case with Paul Dourish who -in his book “Where the action is: The foundations of
embodied interaction” - examines interaction under the lights of phenomenology (Dourish, 2001).
In parallel, the term “Interaction Design” is more and more used as an umbrella-term regrouping
several other disciplines susceptible to take part and shape human-computer interaction issues
(Preece et al., 2007) (Figure 3.1).

Figure 3.1: Contributing academic disciplines and interdisciplinary fields concerned with interaction design
according to (Preece et al., 2007)

87

From the above mentioned approaches and definitions, it becomes apparent that defining
interaction is not a simple task. This is the first reason for which no attempt has been so far made
to concretely define what interactive means as to the use of mobile multimedia museum guides.
The second reason is that unlike many other HCI examples provided by other applicationdomains (static or mobile, single or collaborative), interaction in the examined domain appears far
more complicated as an issue: the target is not merely a computer user but primarily a museum
visitor. Therefore, the use of the interactive application can not be examined only per se, but has
to be placed in the broader context of the museum visit, also referred to as the museum experience
(Falk and Dierking, 1992).
This topic caught the attention of researchers as early as 2001(Aoki et al., 2001). Aoki et al.
demonstrated that a museum visitor using a mobile multimedia guide as an interpretation medium
is susceptible to interact with one of the three following entities:
1. With the mobile interactive application Interact with the system (1)
2. With the environment, meaning the museum display (2)
3. And, finally, with other visitors or co-visitors (3)
However, the proposed scheme can be enriched and extended if we also examine other possible
combinations between these interaction entities. Museum visitors using mobile museum guides are
completely capable of interacting simultaneously with more than one entity: for example, and as
we already saw in Chapter 2, a collaborative activity proposed by a mobile museum guide, will
make the visitors interact between them through the use of the mobile device but also through
shared vision of a specific artifact. By examining all possible scenarios, starting from the 3 entities’
list proposed by (Aoki et al., 2001), we eventually obtain 7 interaction variations. The museum
visitor visiting a museum and making use of a mobile multimedia museum guide might:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Interact with the system (1)
Interact with the environment (2)
Interact with other co-visitors (3)
Interact through the mobile system with the environment (1) + (2)
Interact through collaboration or shared vision with the environment (3) + (2)
Interact through collaboration or shared vision and the use of mobile device with the
environment (3) + (1) + (2)
7. Interact through the use of the mobile application with other co-visitors (1) + (3)
(Numbers in parentheses refer to Figure 3.2, where the main interaction entities are shown)

88

Figure 3.2: Co-existence of interaction entities in the museum setting
In addition, these types of interaction may succeed each other in a quite unpredictable way as the
interaction target or entity might switch from one entity to a combination of entities and vice
versa. This practically means that the use of a mobile museum guide might involve parallel and
synchronous interaction with several entities at the same time, essentially residing either in the
physical, surrounding environment or the digital, accompanying multimedia application. For a
smooth switching of attention from the physical to the digital and vice versa, the visitor needs to
master the links between these two worlds.
There are two important conclusions that can be drawn from the above remarks: The first is that
one should be careful whenever discussing interaction regarding the use of mobile museum
guides. The type of interaction on focus has to be carefully defined: Is it the interaction solely with
the device? Is it the interaction between the device, the visitor and the object? Or is it rather the
interaction between other co-visitors while using the device?
The second important remark, is that as a great part of the activity of museum visitors is detected
during the task of switching the attention from the device to the environment and vice versa, the
creation of straightforward bonds between these two, could facilitate the visiting experience both
in the surrounding museum space and in the multimedia application. This aspect has been also
examined in section 2.4.2 where the geolocalization issue was introduced and the most important
geolocalization methods were described. Therefore, enforcing the bonds between the physical and
the digital is not only important for the geolocalization of the visitor and the correlation of the
signifier –the multimedia application- and the signified –the museum object on display- but also
for the interaction of the visitor with the application, the museum space and other co-visitors.

89

In the remaining of this chapter we will argue that the introduction of a still emerging technology,
Augmented Reality (AR), could greatly contribute to several of the interaction issues examined
above. The main promise of AR technologies is to enrich or augment our perception of the real,
physical environment by overlaying on it virtual and registered in 3D information. From this point
forward we will refer to this mechanism using the term “AR metaphor”, in order to differentiate it
from the practicalities involved with the implementation of AR applications. In the context of use
of mobile museum guides, the introduction of the AR metaphor could be used so as to enable the
museum visitor to use the real museum environment as a point of reference, instead of searching a
point of reference on a digital, physically non-related with the environment, source of data. In
order to accomplish this, the visitors would have to “scan” with their device the environment and
wait to see the available information, making appeal to their intuitive knowledge.
Intuition is a more and more often used word in interaction design as is the term “affordance”,
introduced by Donald Norman in 1990 (Norman, 1990). However here, the term intuitive
knowledge is borrowed by the well known cognitive psychologist Howard Gardner, whose
definition of intuitive could be used as an important argument for the introduction and the
adoption of AR technologies. AR is preoccupied with augmenting the real world and the real
objects surrounding us with computer generated information. The intuitive knowledge, on the
other hand, as defined by Gardner is the considerable amount of knowledge all individuals acquire
at the very first years of their life “by virtue of their interactions with physical objects and with other persons.”
Gardner also includes at this definition “the initial understanding about the predictable behaviors of objects in
the environment…the physical appearance of familiar entities and other universally accessible forms of information.”
(Gardner, 1990).
The question that arises therefore is whether the use of AR technologies and the AR metaphor
could build on the intuitive knowledge principle, in order to assist individuals to interact in a more
intuitive way with computer applications, other people and the environment. The definition of
intuitive knowledge by Gardner stresses out that it is principally through physical interaction with
objects that we learn during the first years of our life. Consequently, if human-computer
interaction gets removed from the computer device and re-integrated back to the real world, it
might be easier for museum visitors to navigate in the different information layers provided by the
mobile multimedia applications and orientate themselves, both in the museum space and in the
application environment. In order to further examine the potential of this approach, a more
detailed study of the main AR principles and its current uses will be examined, with a particular
focus in applications regarding intelligent cultural heritage.

3.3 DEFINING AUGMENTED REALITY

3.3.1 AR AND THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES

Augmented Reality (AR) is a relatively recent computer science field considered as a subfield of
the broader concept of Mixed Reality (MR). The term started to become widely used after 1993,
the year in which the ACM Communications magazine dedicated an entire issue to the subject
(Cohen, 1993, Mackay, 2000). However, the use of the first head mounted display, created by Ivan
Sutherland, dates back in 1968 (Sutherland, 1965, Sutherland, 1968). Because of the limited in
processing power hardware, the application displayed only a simple wireframe model overlaid into
the real world. The mechanism that was used to hold the Head Mounted Display from the ceiling
was the reason for which the application was also described as the sword of Damocles (Kiyokawa,
2007) (Figure 3.3).
There exist several definitions for AR which rather complete than contradict one another.
3.3.2 MILGRAM’ S DEFINITION OF AR

In 1994, a year after the special AR ACM Communications issue, Paul Milgram et al. (Milgram et
al., 1994), in their approach of classifying Augmented Reality displays, defined what was thereafter
to be known as the "Reality - Virtuality Continuum", with the goal to promote the understanding
of the interrelations between virtual, mixed and augmented reality environments (Figure 3.4).

Figure 3.3: The first AR display (to the left, the mechanism used to maintain the display in place)

91

Mixed Reality environments are characterized by the combination of the real with the virtual. If
the real world occupies the left of the continuum, the virtual world stands on the other end. It is
however possible to combine elements of the surrounding, real world, in a virtual environment
(Augmented Virtuality) as well as to overlay virtual objects in a view of the real world, if the last is
observed or seen by means of a video or see-through display (Augmented Reality). It is therefore
pertinent to define Mixed Reality (MR) environments as environments in which "real world and
virtual world objects are presented together within a single display, that is, anywhere between the extreme of the
Reality - Virtuality continuum" (ibid, p.283).

Figure 3.4: Milgram's et al. Mixed Reality Continuum (Milgram et al. 1994)
3.3.3 AZUMA’S DEFINITION OF AR

Azuma gave another definition of AR (Azuma, 1997), according to which three requirements have
to be fulfilled by AR applications. More in particular, AR applications have to:
- Combine the real and the virtual
- Be interactive in real time
- Be registered in 3D
The first requirement is the fundamental description of AR, the one that precises that AR
applications combine the real with the virtual. The second requirement differentiates the definition
of Azuma from the definition of Milgram exposed above, as it specifies that the application has to
be interactive in real time; this additional element excludes off-line applications, like for example
the use of 3D effects in cinematographic productions, from the family of AR applications. The
third requirement means that in order to successfully combine in a life-like representation the real
with the virtual in real time, an accurate knowledge of the position of the scene and the camera
that captures the scene is indispensable. The same condition has to be met when one of these two
elements (the scene or the camera) moves.

92

3.3.4 WENDY MACKAY’ S DEFINITION OF AR

Another approach of Augmented Reality which is often enough cited, was proposed by Wendy
Mckay in an article published in 1998 (Mackay, 1998). According to this model based on
numerous observations relevant to a series of projects, there exist three strategies that help in
answering the question “how to augment reality”:
- Augment the user, who thus wears or holds a device, in order to obtain information about
physical objects
- Augment the physical object, by embedding input, output or computational devices
- Augment the environment surrounding the user and the object with independent devices that
collect and provide information.
However, there are several issues that arise from this definition. The first issue is related with the
term “physical object” used in all three declarations. Certainly the definition answers the question
“how” to augment reality but does not shed light on the question “what” to augment. Is it
pertinent to treat the same way all physical objects? For example, does a black and white marker
(see section 3.4.2 and fifure 3.6) qualifies as a physical object the same way as a patient’s body,
augmented with medical imagery so that a doctor can more easily proceed with a surgery or other
intervention?
The second issue is related with the second and third strategy proposed by Mckay. The decade
that has passed since the publication of this study has seen lot of progress regarding the everyday
use of smart devices and appliances. We now talk about ambient intelligence, smart devices or
ubiquitous computing. The progress on the field is so important that most of the times it is now
possible to draw the line between AR applications and smart devices or ambient intelligence
applications.

3.3.5 A SUPPLEMENTARY DEFINITION OF AR

An additional classification scheme for AR applications can be provided if we attempt to define
the nature of the physical object as well as its relation with its virtual counterpart or augmentation.
In this case, instead of attempting to answer the “how” of AR applications, we focus on the
“what”, or the real nature of the object to augment. This approach might help better define, the
“problem-space” (or action-space), which should ideally proceed the phase of applying strategies
(Preece et al., 2007).

93

The new classification scheme that we propose builds on the following observation. AR
applications tend to augment two different types of objects. The augmentation will either augment
an existing physical object (like for example a painting, a patient’s body, an urban setting etc), or
compensate for the lack of an object, as for example is the case with AR applications using
markers to render or help visualize physically non existing objects. The application of this criterion
results in two main categories of AR applications. Starting from the latter, an AR application
would either:
A) Replace/render a physically non existing object. Ideally in this case, the interaction
should give the user the impression of interaction with a real object.
Or
B) Visually supplement an existing physical object.
Additionally, regarding the 2nd case, we propose an additional criterion which will result in the
definition of three subcategories. This second criterion is provided by the interaction possibilities
proposed by the designer of the system. More in particular:
B1) the augmentation can be manipulated through interaction with the physical object:
The user will interact with the real, manipulating the virtual. An example of this subcategory is
provided by the AR paper projects discussed by McKay. The user interacts with the real paper.
His actions are also affecting the virtual counterpart of the application.
B2) the physical object can be manipulated through interaction with the augmentation:
The user will interact with the virtual, manipulating the real. A good example regarding this
category is provided by medical AR applications. The doctor manipulates the virtual (the medical
imagery), so as to interact with the real (the patient’s body).
B3) only the augmentation and not the real object can be manipulated: There exist cases
where it is not possible or desirable to change the state of the real object augmented. In this case,
only the virtual part of the application (the augmentation), can be manipulated. In this category we
can include the AR mobile museum guide prototype, as the user can only interact with the
augmentations, and not with the real object.
Finally, as to the new classification scheme that we propose, it is important to note that cases B1
and B2 can be combined in one single AR application.

3.3.6 DISAMBIGUITIES CONCERNING THE USE OF THE TERM AR

Any researcher having approached the issue of use of mobile guides in the museum setting or
simply just the issue of AR, might have noticed that sometimes there is a disambiguity in the use
of the term “augmented”. As the initial meaning of the verb “to augment” is to render something
greater, in size, extent, or quantity, some researchers employ the word augmentation with this
meaning in order to describe computer systems that add a new dimension to conventional
activities such as a museum visit (Spasojevic and Kindberg, 2001, Ferris et al. 2004). Disambiguity
can also result from the fact that the term “augmented” can also be used for audio (Wakkary et al.,
2004) or haptic augmentations (Bowman et al., 2005), cases that will not be examined in our state
of the art focusing on Mobile AR applications and Cultural Heritage related AR applications.

3.4 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR MOBILE AR SYSTEMS

3.4.1 PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF MOBILE AR SYSTEMS

From the definitions of Milgram (Milgram et al. 1994), Azuma (Azuma, 1993) and Mckay
(Mackay, 1998), one can induce some of the principal components of mobile, AR systems (Figure
3.5). Wearable or portable input (camera) and interaction devices to interact with the augmented
world are needed, displays in order to incorporate the virtual data in the physical world or object,
data storage and access and of course a computational platform for the coordination of the full
chain, including the tracking and the 3D registration of the real scene. Wireless networks could
facilitate the data access if the last is stored on a remote server (Damala, 2007a).

Figure 3.5: Basic components of mobile AR systems
3.4.2 TRACKING AND REGISTRATION

Two mandatory requirements for the implementation of viable and robust AR applications need
further clarification because they are susceptible to confuse AR projects stakeholders who do not
have a technical background, as is the case with cultural heritage related applications. In any AR
application, a tracking mechanism is needed so as to constantly know the position and the angle
by which the physical object is viewed by the camera, in order to register the virtual object with

95

which it will be augmented with respect to the real world. This feature of AR applications is very
important because unlike Virtual Reality applications, where the user is totally immersed in a
virtual environment, the human vision system can difficultly tolerate even small registration errors
present in AR systems (Azuma, 1993).
Tracking can be further decomposed into two main steps: Image processing, in order to extract
some information from the image, and pose estimation itself. The most usual way to achieve this
is by computer vision. Vision-based tracking can occur either through the use of what the AR
community calls fiducials or markers (Figure 3.6) or by using natural features. The first approach is
the easiest to implement. The markers are added to the physical world, are seen by the camera and
detected by the AR software that will decide where to place the augmentation. The most
comprehensible and easy to use package is ARToolkit (ARTOOLKIT) while recently another
system, ARTag (ARTag), has been proposed. The second approach is based on the detection of
natural features and is considerably harder to achieve, depending on the context in which an
application will be used. However, in both cases, if an object is totally or partially occluded, the
augmentation might disappear. For this reason other possible methods could be used alone or in
combination, like mechanical trackers, magnetic trackers, ultrasonic trackers and inertial trackers
(Hollerer, 2004). Finally it should be also noted that the choice of an appropriate method also
depends on the initial requirements set, as the level of accuracy of the final rendering is not the
same for all types of AR applications. For example an AR application for use in an archeological
site does not need the same level of accuracy as a medical AR application, destined to allow a
doctor to operate a remote patient.

Figure 3.6: Examples of fiducials/markers used for pose estimation in AR applications
3.4.3 PANORAMA OF EXISTING AND FUTURE AR DISPLAYS

The issue of candidate platforms for mobile AR applications is of central importance not only for
the level of immersion in the AR applications but also for the possible ways of interaction with the
proposed system (this issue is also discussed in chapter 5, section 5.3). The first experimentations
in mobile AR were based on custom configurations that resulted not only in expensive but also
heavy and bulky equipment usually carried by the user, in addition to wearing a head mounted

96

display. Such configurations could difficultly break in the museum premises, if not for purely
research purposes and will not be examined here, except if related with cultural heritage
applications (see section 3.5.2). The rest of this section sets out to explore other mobile candidate
platforms that are or will be available in the near future and could be appropriate for use in the
museum. Six types of platforms have been identified in total:
1. Pocket PCs or PDAs
As already examined in section 2.3.8, Pocket PCs or PDAs have been often enough be used in the
museum setting for the delivery of interactive multimedia applications. The main disadvantage of
PDAs is their small screen of approximately 2.5 x 3 to 2.5 x 6 inches. At the same time fears are
expressed that in the near future with the widespread adoption of an all-in-one phone, PDAs will
become obsolete. On the positive sides, they are more affordable than other categories of material
and extremely lightweight and easy to carry. Regarding AR applications, Pocket PCs or PDAs
should be equipped with a camera, in order to be considered as candidate platforms.
2. Cell Phones and Smart Phones
The actual offer in the market regarding cell phones is huge, unlike the reserved initial predictions
(Harper, 2003). The current trend wants cell phones to progressively integrate many other
characteristics, like cameras, a sine-qua-non of all AR applications, and of course networking
capabilities. However their processing power is lower than the one found in PDAs and UMPCs.
Nokia’s project MARA explored the use of camera equipped mobile devices as platforms for
sensor-based, video see-through mobile augmented reality in an urban setting (Schmeil and Broll,
2006). France Telecom Research and Development division in UK and France have also
experimented with navigation in an urban environment using cell phones (West, 2006). Finally,
recently audio and multimedia guides’ companies have also started examining the delivery of
exhibit related multimedia content on I-Phones (http://www.sycomore-france.com/)
3. UMPCs or Ultra Mobile PCs and Tablet PCs
UMPCs are dotted with much larger screens and processing power that makes them simply excel
over PDAs, but the disadvantage is that they are considerably more expensive and much heavier
than them. Two specific types of UMPCs are closer examined in section 4.2.1, as this was the
platform that was finally selected for the experimentations in the museum of Fine Arts in Rennes.
To our knowledge this is the 1st type that a museum guide is delivered on UMPCs.

97

4. Handheld Game Devices
Devices of the type of Nintendo DS and Sony’s PSP are designed for playing using one or both
hands making them convenient as candidate platforms for the museum visit. As with PDAs, for
AR applications, a camera should by all means be integrated in the system for an AR system to
function. Nintendo recently announced that a team is working on the creation of a special
Nintendo edition, equipped with an integrated camera, which could be used as a mobile
multimedia guide in a theme park and other tourist attractions. Discussions and a pilot project
have already begun, in co-operation with Disneyland and if things go well the application might be
released in 2009 (Figure 3.7). In the case of platforms like Nintendo or Sony PSP, a serious factor
to take under consideration is the “closed” architecture of such systems.

Figure 3.7: Pilot application running on Nintendo DS, Walt Disney World Resort, USA (illustration extracted
by Joel, 2008)
5. AR Goggles
AR goggles are a much lighter version of head mounted displays. In both cases and as with head
mounted displays (Kiyokawa, 2007), two categories of AR goggles can be distinguished: Optical
see-through displays and video see-through displays. Their main difference is that optical seethrough displays allow the overlaying of synthetic imagery over what the user sees through the
see-through glasses using a combiner (Figure 3.8a, 3.9b, 3.9e). Video see-through displays, like
Sony Glasstron (Figure 3.8b), present to the user the captured version of the real surrounding
environment, combined with the virtual objects, implying that when there is a system failure the
peripheral vision of the user is lost (Kiyokawa, 2007). Their full potential could be unleashed in
the future, when they would be able to connect, ideally wirelessly, with small, easy to carry devices
like cell phones, PDAs etc.

98

6. The future of AR displays
Finally, a more futuristic scenario that has nevertheless made its debut in 2008 is concerning the
implementation of a see-through display that will have the form of a contact lens (Figure 3.9f) and
will provide “first person shooter-type video game”. The University of Washington and the
Pentagon’s science and technology division DARPA are working on this project and believe that
this special type of contact lens will be available in three to five years time (Greene, 2008,
Shactman, 2008). According to the information released, the lens could be used not only as a
display but also as a sensor monitoring the body’s function and alert the user if any sign of
malfunction appeared.
There have also been proposals for displays that at least for the time being remain only design
projects but are nevertheless very inspiring. For example, Mac Funamizu, a Japanese web and
graphic designer, created some mockups of his dreamed or ideal AR display (Figure 3.9d);
according to his words: “This is what I wish the Internet search will be able to do with a mobile device in the
near future. Touch screen, built in camera, scanner, Wi-Fi, google map (hopefully google earth), google search, image
search… all in one device. Like this way, when you can see a building through it, it gives you the image search result
right on the spot.” (Funamizu, 2008).

Figure 3.8a-3.8b: A. Mockup of lightweight optical display (Low, October 27th, 2008) and B. The Sony
Glasstron video see-through display (CNN, February 2, 2000)
Another interesting prototype, directly inspired by the common magnifying (or magic) lens AR
metaphor (Billinghurst, 2004, Brown and Hua, 2006), was proposed by Ryan Olson. The display
has the form of a real magnifying glass and is equipped with a built-in camera with up and down
tilt, a multi-direction thumb control for navigation, a headphone jack, and a USB port for flash
drives, data synchronization and charging (Figure 3.9a). The handle of the lens can be detached
and used as a stylus (Olson, 2007).

99

In conclusion, despite the creativity of both designers and engineers, up till today, no universal,
mass market platform for the delivery of mobile AR applications exists. This has a great impact on
AR HCI issues, as we also saw in this small review of candidate AR platforms: The way and
method of delivering the augmentation to the final user is also capital for the interaction with the
mobile AR system. It is not by hazard that the definition of general HCI principles is not an easy
task for mobile AR applications. This issue shall be further examined in the Methodology chapter,
section 5.3.

3.5 MOBILE AR APPLICATIONS

3.5.1 INTRODUCTION

The very essence of the potential of AR, supplementing the real rather than only acting as a
substitute, has opened up new possibilities in human computer interaction. Though, it is not in the
scope of this study to provide an in depth coverage of all types of Augmented Reality applications,
we shall briefly examine some main categories, in order to form an idea of the full spectrum of the
fields in which AR could be employed, before examining more in depth the affinities between AR
and “intelligent” cultural heritage applications. Already in his article “A Survey of Augmented
Reality”, Azuma (Azuma, 1997) defined six classes of applications for employing AR: medical

100

visualization, maintenance and repair, annotation, robot path planning, entertainment and military
navigation and targeting.

3.5.2 A SPECTRUM OF POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS FOR AR SYSTEMS

There exists a broad spectrum of domains in which mobile AR applications could find meaningful
uses. For example, the piloting training curriculum has been using long time now AR to assist
trainees and instructors in the visualization of landscapes and in the simulation of situations
demanding a prompt response from a pilot. Military training has been also heavily depending on
AR applications and it should be noted that in this specific context of use, AR applications are way
ahead in comparison with civilian uses and case studies (Hollerer, 2004).
The use of AR systems could also make benefit the industrial chain of productions or operation
of assembly and maintenance. Boeing has been one of the first companies to experiment with an
AR system conceived to assist in the construction chain (Hollerer, 2004) and recently a major
European automobile constructor also explored the same possibility for the repair and
maintenance of cars (Sandor and Klinker, 2005). The engineer wears a pair of AR glasses and sees
on the vehicle the exact location on which he has to intervene, following well defined steps. Each
time he performs a step and wants to advance further he commands the system using his voice.
Everyday-life tasks involving machines could also be a field for meaningful mobile AR
applications. For example, an employee having to deal with a paper jam on a printer could use a
mobile AR application to obtain assistance instead of looking up a manual.
Medicine is another domain that could benefit by fixed and mobile AR applications. For example
a doctor could be assisted by the overlay of virtual information on a patient’s body to visualize
elements that are invisible with naked eye or to perform high precision tasks (e.g. perform a
biopsy on a very small tumor).
Another field for which experiments have already taken place is this of urban planning,
architecture and interior design (Binder et al., 2004). The use of AR could not only assist the
domain professionals in planning and visualizing their interventions but also facilitate their
communication and collaboration with their clients, who might have a difficulty visualizing in
three dimensions the proposed solution (Maquil et al., 2007).
Another everyday task on which AR can be applied is tourism, navigation and way finding
(Borntrager et al., 2003). During the last years the market has been witnessing a massive intrusion
of initially PDA based GPS navigation systems, now also available for mobile phones. In parallel,

101

companies are also exploring the potential of integrated AR displays in vehicles, as we can see in
figure 3.8b, where an AR system is integrated on a car’s windshield (Microvision, October 27th,
2008).
Apart from education (Balog, 2007, Shelton, 2002), for which some examples of AR applications
will be provided later on, as they are directly related with the informal learning character of the
museum visit, AR could also revolutionize the game industry by proposing collaborative games
that merge the real scenery with the virtual and therefore by adding a new dimension in playing
and experience-sharing. For example, “Human Pacman” allows game players play Pacman in a
role-playing mode, where some of the players are the ghosts and some others the pacmen, while
the cookies to be eaten are incorporated also in the environment (Cheok et al., 2004). In a
category combining entertainment and education or edutainment as more and more employed,
Ambient Wood proposed to children, equipped with PDAs, to discover a spatial annotations
augmented forest and learn in a playful way some of the characteristics of this ecosystem (Rogers
et al., 2004). An interesting configuration of gaming AR equipment (A-Rage.Com, October 27th,
2008) was proposed by the Australian a-rage project (A-Rage.Com, October 27th, 2008).
However, as AR and MR applications can be delimited only by the imagination, more peculiar
applications are also often enough proposed. An illustrative example is provided by the project
poultry Internet, where a user is able to interact from a distance, with a chicken wearing a special
AR jacket, by manipulating a doll replica of the real animal (Teh et al., 2006).
More unfortunately, as AR is a relatively new discipline, sometimes the arguments used to
promote the use of the technology, are not always very well thought. In one of the largest in the
domain of intelligent cultural heritage annual conferences, held in 2004 (and in which the author
was present), a member of a team presenting an AR system for the rendering of museum objects,
not only wrote but also told the public that the proposed AR system could be used in a museum
to allow handicapped visitors to virtually see museum objects physically exposed in the museum
galleries. Naturally, many participants later discussed in corridors that the solution in this case is
not to invest on cutting-edge AR systems but rather to invest on building the minimum necessary
infrastructure so that handicapped visitors have access to the museum for real.

3.6 AUGMENTED REALITY APPLICATIONS AND CULTURAL HERITAGE

3.6.1 INTRODUCTION

Cultural heritage related AR applications may be considered to form a distinct category of AR
applications, partly belonging to tourism and navigation systems and partly to the category of
educational AR applications. The literature review of all relevant projects resulted in five
categories that will be examined in this section: Fixed Position Indoor or Outdoor AR
applications, Wearable Indoor or Outdoor AR applications, Indoor Mixed-AR Installations,
Mobile AR applications, while AR applications that replace or render physically non-existing
objects, will be examined in a separate section.

3.6.2 FIXED POSITION INDOOR OR OUTDOOR AR INSTALLATIONS

Augmented Reality visualizations can provide extremely meaningful insights when applied in
archaeological or historical parks or museums, not only for the specialist or initiated visitor but
also for the non-specialist or first time visitor who has difficulties in imagining how a site could
initially have looked like. Fixed AR applications have been tested at the Ename centre in Belgium
(Owen et al., 2005). The system superimposes onto the real scene 3D reconstructions of the
monument as it once was, and displays the result on a visualization device (Figure 3.10b). The
same principle is applied in a commercialized system installed in historical and archeological sites
in Portugal, Brazil and China (Thomasson, 2006). The term employed for this product is “Virtual
Sightseeing” but in essence the approach is clearly based on Augmented Reality both in terms of
metaphor and technology. A booth is placed at a certain distance from an archeological
monument. The user is able to rotate the booth around its position like he would do with a
telescope and visualize on the display of the kiosk the monument with augmentations that give a
picture of how the monument would have once been like (Figure 3.10c).
In an indoor environment, Bimber et al. presented the Virtual Showcase, an AR fixed display,
conceived to allow tracked museum visitors to view stereoscopic images of augmented exhibits
(Bimber et al., 2003). The initial scenario was inspired by paleontology and aimed to show visitors
the steps undertaken by paleontologists to reconstruct with muscles, soft tissues and bones the
skull of a dinosaur. An email communication with one of the authors confirmed that the skull
used during this first demonstration was not an original. However in a more recent publication
concerning the second implementation, which resulted in a permanent installation of the
mechanism in the Deutsches Museum in Bonn, Wendler and Fröhlich note that “the showcase

103

contains a real turntable with real artifacts on top” (Wendler and Frohlich, 2005). The visitors put
on stereo glasses and focus on the stereoscopic presentation that they control through a handle
that makes the display rotate (Figure 3.10a).

Figure 3.10a-3.10c: A. The virtual showcase, B. Ename 974 project and C. y-dreams AR outdoor kiosk (see
section 3.6.2 for the sources of the pictures)
However, regarding the museum environment, the disadvantage of this approach is that it is
invasive in character. In addition, as is also the case with multimedia kiosks installed in museums,
this solution demands from the visitors to move from the original museum display to the
multimedia installation in order to consult the provided interpretation material.

3.6.3 WEARABLE AUGMENTED REALITY SYSTEMS

Another distinct category of Augmented Reality applications is this of Wearable Augmented
Reality applications. As in contrast with mobile AR applications presented in section 3.3.5, the
visitor has to “wear” and not just hold the necessary equipment. This is certainly a disadvantage,
as in most cases the equipment is heavy, bulky and fragile though it allows the use of powerful
laptop based processors and head mounted displays.

from (Anastopoulou and Sotiriou, 2005, Gleue and Daehne, 2001)

104

One of the first systems of this type was the ARCHAEOGUIDE project which was launched in
2000 (Gleue and Daehne, 2001, (Vlahakis et al., 2004, Vlahakis et al., 2005, Vlahakis et al., 2003).
The system was conceived for the site of Olympia in Greece and lasted two and a half years. The
goal was the implementation of a system that would assist the visitors of the archeological site in
better understanding how the site would have once looked like using AR technologies. Despite the
fact that the concept ARCHAEOGUIDE set to explore was pioneering, the proposed
configuration of the equipment the visitor had to wear was quite compromising (Figure 3.11b,
Figure 3.12). The system, that demanded from the visitor to wear a head mounted display and
carry the main computational unit in a backpack, was reported by visitors to be heavy and
cumbersome (Vlahakis et al., 2002).

(illustrations extracted by (Vlahakis et al., 2002))
The LIFEPLUS (Innovative Revival of Life in Ancient Frescoes and Creation of Immersive
Narrative Spaces Featuring Real Scenes with Behaviored Virtual Fauna and Flora)

project

(Papagiannakis et al., 2002) can be considered to be the successor of ARCHEOGUIDE not only
because both projects explored the potential of AR techniques used in archeological sites, but also
because several of the ARCHEOGUIDE project stakeholders also participated in the LIFEPLUS
project, initiated in 2002 and completed in 2004.
The main difference between the two projects was that instead of mainly focusing on ancient
buildings and architecture, LIFEPLUS sought to populate with virtual humans the archaeological
site of Pompeii so as to assist visitors in visualizing aspects of the Roman’s everyday life (Figure
3.13). As in ARCHEOGUIDE, the captured video of the real archeological site serves as a canvas
onto which people, animals and plants of the roman era co-exist and interact with each other. The
equipment is basically the same as in ARCHEOGUIDE: the visitor is equipped with mobile
computing equipment carried on a backpack and wears a see-through Head-Mounted-Display

105

(HMD) and an earphone (Figure 3.11a). A tracking system determines their location within the
site and audio-visual information is presented to the visitors superimposed on their current view
of the site. In order to render the visualizations more realistic, extensive work was undertaken for
the rendering and simulation of the 3D humans.
Another related project, also seeking to explore the potential of AR, but this time in an indoor
environment, was the “ecsite/connect” project (Designing the Classroom of Tomorrow by using
Advanced Technologies to connect formal and informal learning environments) (Anastopoulou
and Sotiriou, 2005).

Figure 3.13: Virtual humans acting in Pompeii archeological site, LIFEPLUS project (images source: MiralabGeneva University)
The project used AR technologies in order to assist schoolchildren better comprehend several
physical phenomena, planning for activities that would occur both in the formal classroom
learning environment and in the informal museum learning environment. The experiments took
place in four countries and involved the study of interactive exhibits. The first exhibit, “Why do
planes fly”, came from the Explore-At-Bristol space, in the UK (Figure 3.14c). It aimed to
demonstrate the forces acting on airplane wings and was designed for children between 10-16
years old. The 2nd exhibit was the “Airtrack”, coming from the Museum of Science and
Technology of the University of Athens. The exhibit demonstrated some laws of motion,
particularly principles relative with the phenomenon of friction and was destined to children aged
15-16 years. Its title was “What stops things from moving?” (Figure 3.14b). The 3rd exhibit was
named “What keeps a balloon moving up and down?” and was hosted in the Heureka centre,
Vantaa, Finland (Figure 3.14d). The target group of this intervention were children between 11-13
years old that would explore this way the relations between pressure, volume and temperature.
Finally the 4th exhibit, the “Biotube”, came from the Xperiment Huset, Växjö, Sweden and aimed

106

to teach students several aspects of photosynthesis (Figure 3.14a). The elements appearing on the
display the students wore were manipulated with a wireless mouse.
Despite the burden of the proposed AR equipment, the “connect” project set out to explore
several innovative ideas like the creation of links between formal and informal learning
environments and the definition of a course of action for the pre and post-visit phase. In addition
the proposed approach was evaluated in real conditions, involving real users (Sotiriou et al., 2006).
Regarding the museum environment however, the use of indiscrete, large markers can be
considered as being rather invasive in character.

Figure 3.14a-3.14d: The four exhibits used in connect project (Anastopoulou and Sotiriou, 2005)
3.6.4 MIXED AND AR INSTALLATIONS

This category is examined separately from the first category “Fixed Position AR applications” on
purpose, as it includes systems that borrow both from AR and MR applications are multimodal
and combine the synchronous use of more than one displays or interaction devices.
VITA (Visual Interaction Tool for Archaeology) is a Mixed Reality (MR) system for the offline
visualization of an archeological dig (Benko et al., 2004). The data gathered for the project came
from the archeological excavations of Stanford University in Monte Polizzo in Sicily, using various
documentation methods such as 3D laser scanning, video sequences, panoramic images and high
resolution images of artifacts discovered during the excavation. The goal was to collect diverse
material for an accurate off-line and off-site visualization of the architectural remains, the digs
(pits), and the objects excavated. For the visualization the system used a tracked, head-worn, seethrough display and for the interaction with the virtual objects the users could use either tracked
gloves or a special table surface on which their gestures could be detected. The system was then

107

tested not only with archeologists but also with archeology students who reported that the system
helped them to visualize the archeological site and to easily locate the distribution of the excavated
objects in the excavation area (Figure 3.15).
A similar experience, but this time using only a table surface and a normal brush as interaction
tool, was created for the Seattle Art Museum as part of the Sichuan China artifact exhibit in
collaboration with the HITLab in Washington. Though according to the webpage of the project
(http://www.hitl.washington.edu/research/sichuan/), more than 25 000 participated in this
experience, it seems that unfortunately no publication on the project is available.

Figure 3.15: VITA system: Real view of the excavated site and its MR lab reconstruction (Benko et al., 2004)
Another installation based on the concept and techniques of AR was implemented and tested with
real museum visitors in the frame of the “One Rock” project (Reeves, 2004, Reeves et al., 2005).
The AR installation made part of an exhibition regarding a large rock in Morecambe bay, England
and had the form of a Telescope, allowing visitors to examine one by one, hundreds of bottles
placed on a metal structure a bit further, the “Incubator”, which contained several specimens of
microscopic sea life elements collected on site.

3.6.5 AR REPLACING/SUBSTITUTING REAL OBJECTS

According to the definition we proposed in section 3.2.5, there also exists another group of
distinct AR applications. In this case the AR installation or solution proposed does not
supplement or augment a physically existing cultural object but is rather used as a substitute or
replacement, either because the real object is not impossible to be used or because the real object
is not desirable to be augmented. This kind of solutions can be usually more low-cost and present
the advantage that the object to be augmented stays intact.
An example of the second case is provided by the ARCO project (Petridis et al., 2005, Sylaiou et
al., 2005, Walczak et al., 2005, Walczak and Wojciechowski, 2005, White et al., 2003,

108

Wojciechowski et al., 2004). Among the goals of the project was the creation of a system that
would allow museum curators to create exhibitions of objects that are not displayed in the
museum exhibition but stored in a storage room. This is a realistic case study as the large majority
of museums around the world cannot afford to have on public display all of the objects they
possess. This kind of system could allow remote students or researchers to examine 3D replicas of
an object without having to be displaced, or school children to have the impression that they hold
and manipulate valuable and usually very fragile ancient objects. This way, museums could be
assisted in the valorization of all the richness of their collections. Another project of this type is
the “virtuoso” project, aiming to assist the teaching of history of art, either in the museum or the
school premises. Using the technique of markers, Mr .Virtuoso proposes to young students to use
their PDAs, in order to visualize art objects and arrange them with the correct chronological order
(Wagner et al., 2006).

Figure 3.16: AR applications used as substitutes of real objects. Illustrations extracted from (Liu et al., 2007,
Woods et al., 2004)
Five other innovative applications developed for exhibitions and science centers are presented by
Woods et al. (Liu et al., 2007, Woods et al., 2004). The SOLAR system, created for the TeManawa
science center in New Zealand, invites the visitor to try to place all planets around the sun in their
correct location. When this is done the planets begin to orbit around the sun (Figure 3.16a-3.16b).
What is very interesting in this example is that the images used for the final rendering of the
planets are based on accurate satellite imagery, allowing visitors to compare the surface of each
planet. The visitors can play two by two holding a visor that allows them to see the planets, as
shown in Figure 3.16b. This group of scientists has also experimented with several prototypes of
AR books (Grasset et Al., 2007a). These can be read as any other normal book, but the use of a
similar AR visor allows virtual characters to jump out of the book and act the story. Another
group of researchers also experimented with the use of AR for teaching sciences, but this time in a
more formal class environment (Figure 3.16c) (Liu et al., 2007, Woods et al., 2004). The obvious
advantage with this kind of approach in teaching is that students can progress advancing at their
own pace. Finally a more recent example comes from the Futuroscope in France and –equally

109

using the marker technique- allows users not only to visualize how the animals of the future could
look like but also see how these animals would interact between them if they were met
(Futuroscope, 2008). The user can group the markers representing the animals and see in 3D how
they would behave. From the above mentioned experiences, the Black Book and the Animals of
the Future just mentioned can be also downloaded and executed at home, using a standard web
cam.

3.6.6 AUGMENTED REALITY ON MOBILE SYSTEMS

As the proliferation of mobile devices and services does not cease to demonstrate a dynamic that
influences most aspects of our everyday life, it is very natural that several groups of researchers
around the world join forces in order to create AR applications that will be low cost and delivered
to users self-owned mobile devices, such as cell phones, smart phones or PDAs (Wagner, 2007).
In section 3.4.3 the Nokia MARA project was briefly presented as well as similar experimentations
carried out in France Telecom RD division. In both cases the projects envisioned to augment
outdoor environments with annotations revealing the nature of the seen objects, for example the
opening hours of a shop or other relative information.
In the domain of cultural heritage, these kind of approaches are still rare, but have nevertheless
began. The first example that can be provided is strongly related with the ARCHEOGUIDE
project discussed above, in section 3.5.2. After trying out the initial configuration and receiving as
feedback from visitors but also archeologists that the system is too heavy and bulky to be
considered for use, PDAs and Tablet PCs were used, resulting in two brand new products one of
the stakeholders commercialized, for use in indoor and outdoor spaces (Vlahakis et al., 2005).
The Bauhaus University AR group in Weimar, after releasing as a commercial solution the
studierstube tracker, an AR computer vision library destined to mobile devices and cell phones in
particular, has started to explore the potential of use of cell phones in the museum for guidance
using AR (Bruns et al., 2007). However so far only results concerning the system performance
have been reported and no user-centered study is known to have been released.
Finally, a group in Japan has been moving towards partially realizing the scenario proposed by the
Dinohunter project discussed in section 2.4.7. They used a PDA in order to allow visitors at the
National Science Museum in Tokyo, Japan augment dinosaurs’ skeletons and visualize how they
might have looked like (Kondo et al., 2007).

110

Figure 3.17: The AR guide implemented for the Museum of Natural History, Tokyo, Japan (Kondo et al.,
2007).
3.6.7 CONCLUSIONS

All of the examples mentioned above demonstrate that AR can indeed have very meaningful
applications regarding the interpretation of Cultural Heritage as it allows for the invisible to be
seen, in a playful way that has been reported to attract visitors of all ages and backgrounds (Woods
et al., 2004). However, fixed-position AR installations that have already been used in outside
environments -like archeological and historical sites- are invasive in character and static, allowing a
one to one relationship with the augmented objects. On the positive sides, their configuration
allows robust and precise AR visualizations, as they make use of hidden, powerful processing
units.
Wearable AR systems, composed by a processing unit, usually worn by the visitor or the user
together with a head mounted display, also allow rich AR visualizations to be created but are
usually custom-made, heavy and bulky and -often enough- fragile. It goes without saying that this
kind of equipment could not be used in a museum if not for purely research purposes. If, in
addition, the system requires the use of large and indiscrete markers, as was the case with the
“ecsite/connect” project, then things get even more complicated.
Mixed reality installations on the other hand can be considered more as part of an exhibition and
less as an interpretation medium for a particular exhibit. It should nevertheless be stressed out that
this kind of installations have a very good potential and could add a lot to the comprehension of
the difficult principles, situations or objects, like natural and physical phenomena.
As learning in the museum has always been a mobile experience, it seems that AR applications
that could be run in a visitor- or museum-owned terminal could be very promising. However as
with all the above discussed cases, this solution also presents some disadvantages. If the enddevice has a very small display, the interaction surface is very limited. This was clearly illustrated in

111

Chapter 2, were we saw that the majority of mobile museum guide projects have either used PDAs
or cell phones as delivery-platforms. In two cases TabletPC were used, which are more powerful
but considerable heavier than PDAs. In the future the combinations of such devices with special
see-through goggles could give new directions and inspire a lot of ambition to mobile museum
guide projects, but for the time being, such displays are still very limited in capabilities and also
extremely expensive.
In order to further examine this presumed potential of AR in the museum environment, we will
progressively examine all phases of an experiment including the design, implementation and
evaluation of a mobile AR guide, created for the museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, Brittany, France.
As we will see further on, in Chapter 4, the main goals were to explore to which extent AR has the
potential of helping navigation and object finding in the museum environment but also in the
multimedia application and to investigate the impact of this approach and intervention on
museum visitors. The first step to realize towards this direction and before even contacting the
museum professionals was the creation of a comprehensive functions list. The process followed
and the results obtained will be presented in the following chapter.
3.7 LIMITATIONS OF THE AR APPROACH

Clearly, AR might have a tremendous potential if introduced as a component of mobile
multimedia museum guidance systems.
The first and most important feature coming from the very essence of AR technologies is that the
full surrounding environment has the potential of becoming an interaction surface, overcoming
the limits of conventional mobile displays (Damala et al., 2007a, Damala et al., 2007b). In addition,
as in most museums museum exhibits are fragile, the visitor has the possibility of contemplating
an object from all possible views and even interact with it so as to change it. Most importantly, AR
makes the invisible visible, allowing thus to museum or school educators to teach effectively
children about physical phenomena. This very same characteristic could allow a museum visitor to
visualize the exact context of an exposed artifact, which is often crucial for the full appreciation
and understanding of an object’s use. In addition it seems more than probable that removing the
reference point from the mobile museum guide application to the environment or object to which
the multimedia reference points could help in bridging the gap between the physical
document/object and its digital/virtual counterpart.
However one should also bear in mind the current limitations of the AR approach, linked mainly
with the current state of the art in the field. And these are unfortunately numerous. The lack of

112

robust, affordable and dedicated displays renders the proposed solutions heavy, expensive and
fragile. The fact that no standard, widely adapted display exists complicates also the issue of HCI
with AR applications. Indeed, the full surrounding environment has the potential of becoming an
interaction surface. But when the computer or the portable display will have disappeared, how are
we going to interact with this new world? Accurate, fast and robust tracking, especially in outdoor
or changing environments constitutes a real barrier in AR applications and a domain still in full
development. At the same time, there is a profound lack of dedicated authoring tools, making
practically impossible even for computer literate museum professionals to embark on relevant
projects. If finally they do so, they often have difficulties expressing their needs in terms of AR
scenarios, as they are not aware of what they can expect from the technology (Damala, 2007a).
Finally there exists also a certain lack in user-centered evaluation of the AR approach. As a result
in many cases the claim that AR can indeed facilitate HCI remains just a hypothesis (Anastassova
et al., 2007a). This scenery sometimes leads to incorrect motivations for proposing AR
approaches, as illustrated by the scientists that claimed that AR can be a panacea for museums that
can not provide access to handicapped visitors. Ideally, the discussion about the integration or not
of the AR principle should not in any case shade the necessary requirements-analysis phase that
has to accompany any mobile museum guide project.

3.8 DISCUSSION

This chapter introduced the multiple dimensions the term interaction acquires with regards to the
use of mobile multimedia guides in the museum context. A brief examination of the evolution of
the term interaction was followed by the domain specific approach of Aoki et al (Aoki et al.,
2001)., who defined 3 entities with which the museum visitor will interact while using a mobile
museum guide. Taking this definition forward, we enriched it by discussing 7 different variations
of possible interactions and interaction entities during a museum visit, while using a mobile
multimedia museum guide. We then looked into the modalities involved while visitors switch their
attention from the physical (the museum and the museum objects) to the digital (the mobile
application) and vice versa and pronounced the hypothesis that AR interfaces might facilitate this
capital in importance task by building on the principle of intuitive knowledge as introduced by the
cognitive psychologist Howard Gardner.
In order to better comprehend the potential of the technology and explore paradigms of use, an
overview of AR basic principles was provided and a spectrum of possible mobile AR applications
was presented. AR applications related with cultural heritage were examined in more depth

113

through classification in five categories. Advantages and disadvantages of all five categories were
also resumed and discussed with regards to the potential of AR for use in mobile multimedia
museum guides. After having traced this way the possible advantages of the introduction of AR on
mobile museum guides, known and existing deadlocks that could slow down the wide adoption of
the proposed approach were also examined.
The next chapter will present the numerous steps undertaken in order to validate the potential of
mobile AR in the museum setting, through the creation of a comprehensive functions’ list and the
participative conceptual and interaction design of a mobile AR-enabled mobile museum guide for
the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, France.

CHAPTER 4
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AR GUIDE

4.1 INTRODUCTION

In the previous chapter, the complex issue of interaction with mobile museum guides was put
forward, providing arguments for the interest of examining the integration of AR technologies in
mobile museum guide projects. The affinities between AR systems and intelligent cultural heritage
applications were particularly highlighted.
This chapter aims to further delve into the numerous steps that were necessary in order to
conceive, design, implement and assess a mobile, AR-enabled museum guide prototype that was
used in order to contact and invite the local museum of Fine Arts in Rennes in participating in a
common research project. It then presents the diverse necessary actions undertaken in order to
come up with a new, specific to the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes prototype, robust and rich
enough in content, in order to be evaluated under real museum conditions.
4.2 A COMPREHENSIVE FUNCTIONS LIST

4.2.1 INTRODUCTION

Prior to the design of a new interactive product or application, it is important to identify needs
and establish requirements (Cheng and Atlee, 2007). With regards to our research hypothesis concerning the integration of mobile AR in mobile museum guidance systems- section 2.1,
examining the role of mobile multimedia guides in the museum, and 2.2, where classification
criteria regarding mobile museum guides were introduced, can provide considerable aid regarding
the initial stages of requirements analysis.

117

However, another important and crucial parameter in order to come up with a successful product
is to approach and understand the nature of the “problem-space” (or “action-space”), also defined
as “understanding and conceptualizing what is currently the user experience product and how this is going to be
improved or changed” (Preece et al., 2007). This can be achieved through user/task analysis and the
generation of detailed task descriptions that can be further decomposed, so as to establish -at the
same time- a basis of already existing practices on which new requirements can be build (Bowman
et al., 2005, Preece et al., 2007).
Especially concerning our case study that proposes the integration of a still emerging technology
in an already existing and tried out interactive product type, the compiling of existing and possible
future mobile guide functions seemed absolutely necessary, in order to examine possible ways by
which AR could alter and enhance already existing functions or become an inspiration for new
ones.

4.2.2 AN INVENTORY OF MOBILE MUSEUM GUIDES FUNCTIONS

In order to identify needs, establish requirements, better understand the nature of the “problemspace” and lay the foundations for user/task analysis, a comprehensive functions list was created.
Possible functions were collected through a thorough literature research, taking under
consideration different types of possible museum objects on display (e.g. everyday life objects,
paintings, sculptures, coins, manuscripts etc). This inventory was then used to populate a table
(Table 4.1) that was at first discussed with history of art and museum professionals of the local
University Department of History of Art (University of Rennes 2). Two of the authors’
publications also put forward the importance of the issue of creating and populating a
comprehensive functions list (Damala et al., 2007a, Damala et al., 2007b).
As the table is quite extensive (comprised of 29 functions in total), instead of discussing each
function separately, only the necessary elements for reading Table 4.1 will be provided, as well as
additional general remarks that can be applied to all of the included functions.
The 1st of the six fields of the table provides the name of the Function/Task. The 2nd field
provides a description of the task and its context of use. The 3rd field presents illustrative use-case
scenarios related with the function examined. The 4th field is named “class”, because as we will see
a bit further, in section 4.2.3, four types of functions were identified. The 5th field accommodates
possible advantages, disadvantages or open questions related with each function. Finally, a 6th field
examines in which way AR technologies and the AR metaphor can be of interest for the function
in question.

118

A general remark that can be applied to all of the examined mobile museum guide functions is
that two categories can be distinguished: The first category embraces functions indispensable to
the guide but –ideally- invisible to the user. Orientation, geolocalization, live streaming,
registration and logging visitors' actions, fall under this category. The second category of functions
is more explicit for the visitor and forms the core of allowed/suggested interactions in between
the visitors and the exhibits. In this category one can include the use of avatars and storytelling,
the possibility to provide personalized souvenirs or merchandise or to bookmark parts of the visit.
Trying to draw the line in between these two categories could ensure that the interdisciplinary
teams formed for the design and implementation of the guide are more efficiently subdivided in
discipline-appropriate tasks, thus shortening the human and material resources needed for the
completion of a project (Damala et al., 2007b).

4.2.3 CLASSIFICATION OF MOBILE MUSEUM GUIDES FUNCTIONS

However, a closer look at the above inventory (Table 4.1) reveals that a more abstract taxonomy
might also be deduced. Working further with the set of functions examined above, led to the
distinction of four types of mobile museum guidance systems’ functions: Contextualization,
communication, personalization and museum data management.
1.

Contextualization

Contextualization is a term initially used in biblical studies but steadily adopted from the 70s
onwards a lot in cultural studies, especially archaeology, where the notion of “context” is of
paramount importance (Renfrew, 2000). It is in this spirit that the term was chosen for our
taxonomy, in order to express all functions that help a visitor re-place a museum object in its
original context. A burial, for example, is constituted by a “closed” group of objects that when
exposed obtain their full meaning only through examining the existing interrelations. This
“dimension” is often lost in museum exhibitions (Pierce, 1994). The visualization of images,
slideshows, 3D models, animations and avatars used as virtual guides belong in this category as
well as the audio function, the speech-to-text or text- to-speech function or the video function.
Granting to more initiated visitors access to the museum database and providing hyperlinks also
belongs in this category as well as all functions allowing the manipulation of digital artifacts or 3D
models.

2.

Communication

Another distinct set of functions is related with the issue of communication. Communication
functions can assist different kind of communication needs, between the museum and the visitors,
the visitors with the museum, the visitors with other co-visitors and eventually address the need of
communicating parts or the full visit for later consultation, linking thus the pre, during and postvisit experience and strengthening the bonds of the museum with its public. The implementation
of a "sticky notes" function, that would allow visitors to spatially comment exhibits could enhance
the public dialogue around exhibits and engage more the public in the exhibition. Another
example of a communication function is the real-time delivery of alerts regarding closing hours, or
special events taking place in the museum.

125

3.

Personalization

Personalization is another great advantage of the use of mobile guides in the museum setting and
can be said to be a function of its own, composed by different sub-functions. In this report we use
the term personalization with its general meaning, including as well configuration, and without
strictly drawing a line between customization or adaptability, thought to be triggered by the user
itself, and personalization or adaptivity, which lets the system induce the visitors preferences
(Bowen and Filippini-Fantoni, 2004, Proctor, 2004). As already examined in section 2.2.4, there
are many criteria upon which personalization can occur, like age groups, learning styles (Damala,
2007b), disabilities (Proctor, 2004), level of visitors initiation, available time for the visit (Damala
et al., 2005), thematic tours, bookmarking, or social networks. On a more technical level
personalization can also occur according to the terminal chosen and the available bandwidth.

4.

Museum Data Management

Finally, there is a fourth category, completely invisible to the visitor that plays however a major
role in the way the visitor will live the mobile museum guide experience. A common point among
all these functions is that they deal with data (directed to the server by the devoted visitor's
terminal or arriving as a response from the server after a request of the dedicated terminal). It is
for this reason that we chose to name this category "Museum data management", with the term
management embracing the storage, transmission and processing of data. Registration of visitors
terminals, that allows museum staff be aware of the number of visitors in each room as well as
logging in visitors actions belongs in this category, as well as geolocalization, orientation and live
streaming. Modules for content creation, content management and content update can also fall
under this category.
Of course, one has to bear in mind that though in the majority of cases it is relatively easy to
decide in which category to place each listed function, there exist cases for which a function could
be classed under more than one category. For example, logging in visitors actions can be classified
both under the categories of “Museum Data Management” as well as under the category of
“Personalization”, since logging in visitors’ actions could be used in order to propose personalized
exhibit-related content. However, for reasons of simplicity and clarity each function presented in
Table 4.1 is classed under only one category.

126

4.2.4 AR AND MOBILE MUSEUM GUIDES FUNCTIONS

In one of the author’s publications, presented in October 2007 (Damala et al., 2007b), we
supported that “there exists a set of AR functions” and that “their main impact to already tried out
non AR functions is that they have the potential to change the way of interaction as the "scene"
on which the action takes place can move from a tiny computer screen to the full environment
surrounding as, through, for example the use of AR goggles. The same is true for the input and
output devices that can be used to interact with the system”.
Yet a more careful look in the table presented below, particularly in the 6th field presenting the
possible interrelations between AR and each examined function, reveals that in reality the large
majority of the proposed functions can as well be integrated in a mobile museum guide even
without the use of AR. This also leads to the conclusion that AR capabilities are not a prerequisite
but rather a medium through which the design, display and interaction with an interactive mobile
museum guide can be altered.

4.2.5 CONCLUSIONS

This section presented an inventory of mobile museum guide functions, proposing also a
classification scheme and examining the ways in which AR can enhance or alter each suggested
function. The inventory can also serve as a pool of ideas for museum professionals for the
definition of necessary or desirable functional requirements to be integrated in a mobile
multimedia museum guide. The section also examined the interrelations between AR and
proposed mobile museum guide functions. It also suggested that AR in the context of design and
implementation of mobile museum guides is not a prerequisite but rather an alternative choice
regarding interaction design of mobile multimedia museum guides.
4.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE 1 ST MUSEUM GUIDE AR PROTOTYPE

4.3.1 INTRODUCTION

As already mentioned, the functions’ inventory presented in the previous section provided
valuable help regarding a more thorough understanding of the possible functions a mobile
museum guide can integrate but also, more importantly, of the possible ways by which the final
user experience can be shaped using AR technologies and the AR metaphor. The table created was
also used during two brainstorming sessions conducted with a Professor of History of Art and
Archaeology of the local History of Art Department (University of Rennes 2) who validated most
of the possible functions as desirable and usable for the specified context of use. Some slight

127

hesitations were only expressed for the more “futuristic” but also resources-generating functions
(like, for example, proposing personalized merchandise at the end of the visit or providing an
application module for making a reservation in the museum’s café).
After this first validation of the functions list, the time came to proceed with the creation of some
first mockups. However, prior to this activity a decision had also to be taken as to the platform on
which the application would be delivered, given that the size and the controls of the terminal had
also to be taken under consideration during the design process.

4.3.2 CANDIDATE PLATFORMS

For the delivery of the museum AR application three types of candidate platforms were
considered:
1. Mobile phones and smart phones
2. PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants)
3. UMPC (Ultra Mobile PCs)
Mobile phones (including smart phones) provide a small interaction surface and often use
proprietary, “closed”, operating systems that prohibit system-level programming. In addition their
memory (RAM) is limited and usually does not exceed 64 MB, while despite the evolution in the
performance of the built-in cameras, the resolution is still very limited when it comes to video
recording (320 * 240 or 160 * 120 pixels).
PDAs have been largely used in many museum mobile guide projects (see also section 2.2.8 and
Figure 2.3a-2.3.g). Though in comparison with mobile phones, they are equipped with a larger
screen, the interaction surface was judged too small regarding the AR application requirements.
Another reason for choosing UMPCs over mobile phones and PDAs was that UMPCs are much
more performant in processing power and storage capabilities but also in terms of controls, as
they are resemble more to PCs, at least comparing with mobile phones and PDAs.
Two different types of UMPC models were considered for use:
A) Samsung Origami Q1: This UMPC has a 7 inch LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) touch-sensitive
screen, with a maximum resolution of 800 x 480. It weights 779 grams and measures 22, 7 cm *
13, 9 cm * 2, 6 cm. The Q1 is doted with a Celeron M processor of 900 MHz optimized for low
power consumption (ULV), 512 MB of memory, and a hard disc of 40 GB. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
communication capabilities are integrated in the device as well as two USB 2 ports. Windows XP

128

Tablet Edition was the operating system at the time of the implementation of the final prototype
(Figure 4.1).
In terms of user interface and controls, an 8-way direction joystick is present on the right side of
the device as well as an enter/launch key. The right side also possesses a button of quick access to
several UMPC functions. A major drawback was that in the version used, no integrated camera
was available. A standard webcam was connected to the device using one of the two USB ports
(Figure 4.1).

Figure 4.1: Front and back view of the 2nd candidate device equipped with a standard webcam
B) Sony VAIO UX series: This device has a 4.5 inch LCD touch sensitive screen with a 1024 x
600 pixels resolution. The processor is an Intel Core Solo U1400 running in 1.2GHz and the
memory 512 MB. The hard disc can store up to 30 GB while the preinstalled operating system was
Windows XP Professional SP2. The device has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, 3 USB ports, an
Ethernet port, a VGA output, a video-out, plus an integrated camera as in contrast with the
Samsung previously described (Figure 4.2).

Figure 4.2: The 2nd candidate device considered the delivery of the application

129

Though the application run on both devices, it was the Samsung UMPC that was used for the
main experimentations, as the smaller screen size of the VAIO rendered difficult the manipulation
and legibility of the application.

4.3.3 CREATION OF A FIRST MOCKUP

After the requirements analysis phase and the release of the possible functions inventory, the
creation of the first mockups followed (Figure 4.3, Figure 4.4, and Appendix IA). In order to
further facilitate the deployment and implementation of a 1st prototype, it was also judged
necessary not only to adopt a particular object type but also concrete case studies. For enabling a
faster and more robust implementation, the 1st prototype focused on paintings, despite the fact
that other object types (for example statuettes or vases) were also considered. At this stage, the
possible scenarios were not only inspired by the inventory presented in section 4.1, but also from
the particularities of two paintings adopted for experimentations in the lab, Jan Van Eyck’s
“Arnolfini” painting and Van Gogh’s “Café Terrace at Night”. One of the main arguments for
choosing these two paintings was not only that they are very well known, but also that an
abundance of information concerning them was easily available. The script of one of these two
multimedia presentations is available in Appendix IB.
Figure 4.3 pictures a mockup showing a possible way by which visitors could be provided with
way-finding information regarding a painting as well as a way for indicating other available
commented paintings.
Figure 4.4 comes from the mockups created for the “Arnolfini” painting. When the painting is
chosen or detected, the title, the date and the museum collection in which the painting belongs is
displayed on the title bar. To the left, the three images refer to different themes available for each
painting: The “When” theme provides information about the period in which the painting was
created; the “Where” theme provides information regarding the place and context in which the
painting was created; the “How” theme gives information as to the technique employed for the
selected painting. On the top right two other images appear: The first one has the form of an open
notebook, indicating that the visitor is able to create his own notes on the painting, while the callout below indicates that the visitor can write and leave a spatial comment for the painting that will
be later available for consultation by other visitors. The two other images below indicate that the
visitor can e-mail the painting information or bookmark it in order to receive -after the end of the
visit- all bookmarked objects with their comments in a CD or any other storage medium. The
images below the painting indicate the different kind of media available: text, audio, music derived

130

from the period in which the painting dates. The magnifying glass on the centre of the picture
indicates that the visitor can zoom-in in details, for example magnify the mirror behind the
depicted couple or the Latin inscription above it.

Figure 4.3: Mockup created prior to the implementation of the 1st AR prototype
This mockup provides a visualization example of a proposed interface integrating a number of
possible functions presented in the functions’ inventory.

However, because of numerous

difficulties related with the implementation, the 1st prototype could only include and deliver
content in the form of text, audio, 2D and 3D slideshows. With respect to these constraints, the
author created two scenarios, one for each painting (Appendix IB). After the finalization of the
texts and the recording of several audio sequences, the content authoring took place.
The application was programmed in the host lab, using the C programming language and
Microsoft Visual C++ as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The ARToolkit library
(ARTOOLKIT) was used for tracking. In order to enable a more easy content creation without
having to alter the code written, a special module allowed passing on important application
parameters using appropriately formed XML documents (eXtensible Markup Language). In terms
of architecture, the application was composed by two modules: The Magic Engine module and the

131

Magic Player module. The Magic Engine forms the core of the application and is responsible for
the initialization, the 3D registration of the camera, the parsing of the XML files, the creation of
the interface and the rendering of the objects that will augment the scene. The second module was
the Magic Player (Magic stands for Mobile Augmented Guide For Indoor Collections); the Magic
Player receives all relevant data as an input, so as to launch and “play” the presentations.

Figure 4.4: Mockup created prior to the implementation of the 1st AR prototype and detail
The guide was first tested in the laboratory, and then demonstrated on several occasions, among
which the International 2007 Laval Virtual Conference using the Samsung UMPC described in
section 4.2.1, with the addition of a standard webcam (Damala et al., 2007a). The user, holding the
UMPC points the camera towards the two paintings. The screen is divided in two distinct frames,
the ScreenSpace and the ARSpace. The AR Space displays the video captured in real time together
with the augmentations of the real scene. It is surrounded and framed by the ScreenSpace on
which five controls of the application are provided: an “exit” button, a “freeze” button, a “back”
button, a “forward” button and a “pause” button. In addition, the ScreenSpace also displays the
title, the artist and the dating of the painting as well as the dimensions, the materials used and the
museum in which the painting is exposed (Figure 4.5).
The video captured in real time serves both as a background for adding up the virtual overlays but
also as an input for ARToolkit that processes the sequences in order to detect the commented
paintings. When a painting is recognized, the title bar appears on the ScreenSpace, providing

132

information about the artist, the title of the painting and the date. On the right side, the
appropriate information regarding the materials used, the dimensions and the museum where the
painting is exhibited is displayed. The visitor can use the “freeze” button so as to capture a
snapshot of the detected painting and the overlaid information without having to continuously
hold the device at the height of the painting. The “forward”, “back” and “pause” button allow the
control of the multimedia sequences provided for the painting, consisting of audio, text, and 2D
and 3D slideshows. All content and sequences were linearly arranged; subthemes were available in
terms of content but not visible to the visitor who had to navigate linearly from one sequence to
the next one (Appendix IB).
Despite the modesty of this first implementation, in terms of interface, the proposed application,
based on the AR approach, proved to be quite useful, as it generated rich feedback mainly as to
the ways the content could be presented.

It also provided a very useful companion and

demonstrator when the first discussions regarding a possible collaboration with the Museum of
Fine Arts in Rennes (Musée des Beaux Arts de Rennes) were initiated. In parallel a second version
of the AR guide slowly started to take shape, taking under consideration the feedback resulting
from the demonstrations of the 1st prototype but also directives regarding the use of specific tools
and languages to be employed so as to ensure interoperability with other AR and VR related
activities in the host laboratory (France Telecom Research and Development/Orange Labs).

The design and implementation of this 1st prototype but above all its demonstration on numerous
occasions was a first step towards establishing a basis for discussion with the municipality of
Rennes and the local Museum of Fine Arts, as described in the next section.

4.4 MAIN STAKEHOLDERS MOTIVATIONS AND NEEDS

4.4.1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the circumstances under which the experimentation took place is a prerequisite for
the comprehension of the context under which the main research project was shaped but also for
the understanding of the motivations and needs of the main actors that influenced one or more of
the project phases.
After the engineering and first public demonstrations of the 1st prototype took place, the
municipality of Rennes got contacted by France Telecom RD in order to explore the possibility of
a mutual project together with the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes. The municipality brought the
lab in contact with the museum while positioning itself as a co-partner for the project. During the
first meetings a demo was also presented to the museum professionals. The result was an
agreement for the proposal of a research project, to be considered for financing by the French
National Agency of Research (ANR - Agence National de la Recherche). All necessary actions
were undertaken for the composition of the proposal, but in the meantime there was an effort of
presentation of the relative PhD research project to the museum stakeholders, so that the first
experimentations regarding a new AR prototype begin the soonest possible. The museum agreed
and, shortly after, the first meeting in the museum took place in order to organize the following
working sessions. It is important to highlight that the design, engineering, implementation and
assessment of this museum-tailored 1st AR guide did not officially make part of the works
regarding the proposal so whatever time and effort the museum professionals dedicated was
voluntary.

4.4.2 THE MUNICIPALITY OF RENNES
The municipality of Rennes acted as an intermediate for contacting the Museum of Fine Arts in
Rennes in order to propose a collaborative research project based on mobile AR for the museums’
collections. A communication channel with the RD department of FTRD exists since many years,
and among others, has resulted in the past, in a detailed 3D model of the city of Rennes and a
visualization tool for accessing information on public services (location, opening hours, etc.),
public transportation (location, timetable) and sport installations (Cavagna et al., 2006). As the use
and integration of IT technologies in all aspects of civilian life is on the top of priorities for the
local authorities, the municipality of Rennes was very interested in facilitating the contacts with the
museum of Fine Arts in Rennes.

134

4.4.3 FRANCE TELECOM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (ORANGE LABS)

France Telecom is a telecommunications company benefiting from an “integrated operator”
profile including the design, development, research and commercialization in varied fields such as
Internet services, mobile telephony, networks and IT business solutions but also entertainment
and related content creation. Despite the fact that up till today there is no particular lab dealing
with Cultural Heritage related applications, in the past several related commercial and research
projects have been realized (Damala and Bouville, 2006). Among them a system for the complete
recording and documentation of artifacts in the underwater excavations realized in the port of
Alexandria, two other mobile museum guides projects, DANAE and Mobivisit (discussed in detail
in sections 2.3 and 2.4) but also e-tourism applications and 3D intelligent avatars.
The corresponding lab for the AR museum guide project was IAM, a laboratory that has been
mainly focused in 3D and Virtual Reality applications and which lately develops various activities
related with AR technologies.
Conducting experimentations in real-life, indoor, environments -especially in the contextually rich
museum ecology- was seen as a step towards mastering not only more complex AR applications
for outdoor use but also towards

achieving the creation of full-fledged, multimedia, AR

applications to be used in other indoor and outdoor environments.

135

4.4.4 THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS IN RENNES

The Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes is dependent from the French Ministry of Culture but also
directly linked with the Municipality of Rennes that acted as an intermediate for the common
project. The museum has an active policy regarding the use of Information Technologies, a great
sensitivity towards fulfilling its public diverse needs, and -as wee will see in the next section- had
already been implicated in the development of interactive edutainment applications.
For the museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, participating in the project meant implication in the
design of one additional, alternative, educational resource. The avant-gardism of the AR approach
comes with the stake of several constraints imposed by a still evolving computer science discipline
but with the advantage of tailoring a new educational resource for the very particular museums’
needs.
4.5 THE SETTING OF THE MAIN STUDY

4.5.1 ABOUT THE MUSEUM AND ITS COLLECTIONS

Like most museums in France (Schubert, 2000), the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in
Rennes was constituted after the French revolution from works that were confiscated from
civilians and the church (Coulon et al., 2000). However it also acquired the cabinet of curiosities of
Brittany’s parliamentary Christophe Paul de Robien (1698-1756) which was one of the richest
“curiosities” collections in Europe comprised by objects from all continents and periods (Greek,
Egyptian and Roman antiquities but also sketches of artists like Leonardo de Vinci, Botticelli,
Dürer and Rembrandt). In 1810 and 1811 it was also enriched by state loans and donations. In
addition, the museum houses a very important collection of works of modern and contemporary
art and each year organises several temporary exhibitions

4.5.2 MUSEUM DOCUMENTATION POLICIES

The documentation system used by the museum is “micromusee”©, a software highly appreciated
in many national museums in France. The main entries of the catalogue are also publicly available
in

the

French

database

“Jokonde”

(http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/joconde/fr/pres.htm), a collective French national
museum database that boasts more that 347.000 entries. However, as explained later and observed
in practice, the more “traditional” paper folders, containing various kind of information, continue
to be used, alongside with the museum databases. The museum also hosts a library accessible to
students and researchers.

136

4.5.3 EDUCATIONAL POLICIES AND RESOURCES

In terms of educational policies, the museum offers a great variety of educational programs and
workshops, available for different target groups, ranging from children (Figure 4.7b), to adults
(Figure 4.7a) and visitors with special abilities. Educational material is also present in the web site
of the museum alongside with the full contents of the published catalogue of the exhibition.
Podcasts for selected works of art can be freely downloaded from the museum’s web site. The
commented works are designated in the exhibition space using a CD as a marker (Fig. 4.8a).

4.5.4 THE MUSEUM AND ITS RELATION TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES

Available podcasts and the use of databases are not the only affinities of the museum with New
Technologies. Interactive kiosks are available in the museum, for visitors wanting to consult them
while the participation of the museum in the “FRAME” project (French Regional and American
Museum Exchange, http://www.framemuseums.org), resulted in the creation of an online
interactive game for children, the “Room of Wonders”, available in English and French (Fig. 4.8b)
(Moonan, 2007). The museum’s website (www.mbar.org) contains information about the
collections, the history of the museum, but also the educational policies and diverse educational
resources. Recently the museum also undertook the creation of a monthly newsletter.

museum
4.6 LIFE CYCLE OF THE MAIN AUGMENTED REALITY PROTOTYPE

4.6.1 AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH

The particular nature of the planned intervention also manifested itself in the number of the
professionals involved, at least during the early stages of the project. For example, the museum
initial team consisted of a museum curator, all four museum educators, the Internet and new

137

technologies head as well as the head of the public relations and communication of the museum.
The team of the host research lab consisted of two R&D engineers, an ergonomist and the author.
To this total of 12 professionals one should add the representative of the Municipality of Rennes,
who acted as an intermediate between the museum and the lab, as well as a student in internship
in France Telecom R&D who participated in the implementation of the guide. As the design
process gave place to the implementation, other professionals also participated, as was the case
with the museum photographer and two France Telecom R&D lab assistants that greatly helped
the capture of video data during the evaluation process.

interactive game “The room of wonders” (http://www.framemuseums.org/sites/room_of_wonders/intro_en.html)
4.6.2 CONCEPTION AND DESIGN OF THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS AR GUIDE

Prior to the first meetings with the contributing museum professionals, the museum curator and
occasionally the appointed museum educators, a thorough research regarding museum educational
and IT policies was undertaken, using varied resources, such as the museum publications and
educational resources (http://www.mbar.org/services/ressources/index.php), the museum
website, interviews with the museum professionals but also participation in activities such as
children workshops (Figure 4.7b) and guided visits for adults (Figure 4.7a).
The first meeting with the museum occurred in the summer of 2007. As expected, the first steps
consisted of discussing with the museum professionals the notion of introducing mobile guides in
the museum setting. Examples of other relative museum experimentations were discussed as well
as anxieties regarding the effect of introducing a gadget-like interpretation medium in the museum
premises, similar to the ones treated in section 2.6. The first prototype that used the Van Eyck and
Van Gogh paintings was also revisited and displayed in order to better illustrate the notion of
Augmented Reality and the way it could be used in the museum. These steps were crucial as the

138

museum did not have prior experience with mobile guides neither acquaintance with the term
Augmented Reality and the associated technologies.

4.6.3 SELECTING THE PAINTINGS

At this point of the collaboration with the museum, the first prototype stopped being used as a
guide for the implementation of the second prototype. Only one prerequisite was maintained: the
ability of the already developed application to detect and recognize particular paintings in the
museum. As already seen, in Augmented Reality systems, the effectiveness of an application
principally lies in the ability of a system to detect and recognize in real-time, elements of the
surrounding environment so as to “augment” them. This ability is influenced mainly by two
factors: the effectiveness of the embedded algorithm and the capacities of the equipment used.
Especially in a museum, where the display conditions such as lightening, reflections, or the shape
of the picture frames, cannot be adjusted, the application had to be reliable under all
circumstances.
Since at this point the available algorithms were still under constant evolution, it was necessary to
carry out numerous tests in the museum premises, so as to establish a list of “easy-going”
paintings that would not risk neither to perturb the application nor –as a consequence- to frustrate
the participants. A list of 9 paintings was dressed and then presented to the museum curator and
the museum educators (Figure 4.9). Five paintings were retained using as a criterion pedagogical
considerations and a common thematic axis: costumes and dressing. Later on, one more painting
was excluded due to the lack of adequate interpretation material in order to be presented to the
wide public. The four paintings (Figure 4.10) were:

Despite the fact that the official collaboration would not start before January 2008, the museum
affirmed a strong attachment regarding the content to be delivered and undertook the
responsibility to assist throughout the full process of content creation.
4.6.4 DISCUSSING ABOUT THE TARGET GROUP AND THE EVALUATION SESSION

The next important topic to introduce was the target group or more precisely the visitor profile to
which this prototype would be proposed. Suggested groups included children, as well as seniors
and young visitors but finally there was a mutual agreement in that young people between 18 to 30
years old could be the most interesting of all of the proposed target groups. This target group was
presumed to be more at ease regarding the use of information technologies compared with senior
visitors and less susceptible to be influenced by the gadget-like character of the intervention in
comparison with children. In addition young visitors of this age group represented a, “critical”
according to the museums representatives’ words, public.
The museum professionals were further encouraged to express their position regarding the
evaluation process that would follow and were invited to participate. Despite their strong interest
in evaluation and assessment, the museum partners stressed out that they were open in hearing
proposals. The known facts at this point of the experimentations were that due to the highly

140

experimental nature of the guide and the study, a qualitative rather than quantitative approach
should be adopted and that a combination of various methods would seem more appropriate (as
to the issues concerning evaluation, see also Chapter 5).
Like with the process of content creation, the museum assumed an important role regarding the
recruitment of the candidates and proposed to contact two different university departments, the
local School of Fine Arts and the Technical University Institute of Social Sciences. The hypothesis
here was that the students of Fine Arts would be more “experienced” and demanding museum
visitors in comparison with the 2nd group of students.
The final evaluation protocol finally prepared and proposed to the museum professionals is
further discussed in the 5th Chapter, Methodology for Evaluation and Data Collection section and
in Appendix IV. The next section presents the architecture –in terms of implementation- of the
Museum of Fine Arts prototype.
4.7 DESCRIPTION OF THE 2 ND MUSEUM GUIDE AR PROTOTYPE

4.7.1 INTRODUCTION

As we already saw, the 1st prototype was programmed in C and used the ARToolkit library for the
identification of the commented works and their annotation with virtual widgets. Some of the
most basic principles already present in the 1st prototype, for example, the use of XML files for
the separation of each presentation parameters from the actual 3D rendering application, were
kept intact. In a higher level, the separation of the PaintingGuide between two different modules,
the “Magic Engine” and the “Magic Player” was also to be kept. In terms of hardware, the same
configuration was used as with the 1st Prototype.
However, two important elements underwent important changes: In the 2nd version the package
ARToolkitPlus had to be used instead of the ARToolkit library. An important change also
occurred regarding the rendering engine, where Ogre3D had to be chosen, in order to ensure
interoperability with other AR and VR applications under development in the host laboratory. The
next section provides an overview of the tools that were used for the final prototype as well as
information regarding the architecture of the application and the interactive features of this
version.
The copyright for the use of the Picasso’s painting belonging to both the Museum of Fine Arts in
Rennes as well as to the Picasso Foundation makes impossible the reproduction of the painting without a
special permission.

4.7.2 SYSTEM PIPELINE AND IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS

As most typical AR systems which use a single video source both for tracking and see-through
display (Wagner and Schmalstieg, 2003), the processing pipeline was composed of the following
main tasks: Video acquisition, tracking, application computation, rendering and display. In the
particular case of the museum of Fine Arts, the video is acquired by the webcam attached to the
UMPC. Then the application checks whether the video frames contain one or more known
patterns. When a pattern – a particular painting in our case- is detected the application
computation and the rendering follows in order to obtain in a single display the combination of
the real object, the painting, with the virtual, e.g. an avatar acting as an e-docent. (Figure 4.11). As
in the 1st prototype, the AR scene is composed by the ARSpace, that uses the video acquired in
real time as a background for the display of virtual, 3D-registered objects and the ScreenSpace that
frames the ARSpace in which buttons or textual information may appear (see also section 4.2.3).

Figure 4.11: Pipeline of the Museum of Fine Arts Augmented Reality Guide
4.7.3 IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS

For the implementation of the application, the following tools and software packages were used
(Jouvin, 2007):
Video acquisition and Tracking: For video acquisition and tracking, ARToolkit Plus
was used and a webcam Plug-in of Ogre 3D (presented below). ARToolkit and ARToolkitPlus
are software libraries that facilitate the implementation of AR applications, using video tracking
capabilities in order to calculate in real time the camera position and orientation with respect to
the markers provided. ARToolkit Plus was especially conceived for low-end devices where often
memory and processing power is much limited comparing with PCs. However, a serious
disadvantage is that this free version is no longer supported and that compatibility with ARToolkit
is broken because of the C++ based API. Together with the ARToolkit+ package, OpenCV, a
well known multiplatform computer vision library, focusing mainly on real time image processing
was also used for the capture of the webcam sequences.

142

3D Application Rendering: OGRE 3D (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)
was the 3D rendering engine used for the AR application. Ogre3D is written, as ARToolkitPlus, in
C++. Its object-oriented design provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive
classes and benefits of a plug-in architecture that makes it highly modular. OGRE 3D also
supports the OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) and Direct3D libraries while remaining
multiplatform.
2D Application Rendering: For the rendering of all 2D elements (buttons, display bar,
image etc) the CEGUI (Crazy Eddie's Guide User Interface) API, a C++ graphical user interface
library compatible with Ogre3D was used.
XML parsing: XERCES is the XML parser that was used. XERCES gives executables
the possibility to read but also write XML data. It is conformant with the XML 1.0 and 1.1
versions while a library is provided for parsing, generating, validating and manipulating XML
documents.
Application Audio: Finally OpenAL (Open Audio Library) a free, cross-platform audio
API, was used for the manipulation and delivery of the audio files of the application.

4.7.4 ARCHITECTURE OF THE 2ND AR PROTOTYPE

As we saw in the previous section, the input provided by the museum visitor is the filming or
“scanning” of the surrounding environment with the web camera. When a painting is detected,
virtual widgets appropriately positioned, appear on the screen and guide the visitor’s navigation in
the available content for each painting. The schema in Figure 4.12 reveals the architecture of the
new prototype, the principal application components and the system’s pipeline. However, a more
careful look reveals that the system architecture obeys the general architecture abstraction
provided by Williams et al. (MacWilliams et al., 2004), where a common basic architectural
structure for AR systems is presented. According to this model, each AR system can be
decomposed in six core subsystems: The Application subsystem, the Interaction subsystem, the
Presentation subsystem, the Tracking subsystem, the Context subsystem, and the World model
subsystem.
Application Subsystem: Magic engine is the core engine and the module linking all of the other
APIs used for the application.

143

Tracking and World Model Subsystem: The video is captured by the Webcam Plug-in that
uses the OpenCV library. The images captured are sent to the ARToolkit who is provided with a
list of markers that should be detected in the captured image using computer vision algorithms.
The output of this process is a transformation matrix, allowing the calculation of the position and
the orientation of the camera regarding the identified marker. The matrix is then transferred to the
engine of the application and more precisely to the AR Listener module. The video sequence
captured is then used as an Ogre 3D texture and serves as a “background” for the application.
Context Subsystem: The context subsystem in our case is the module AR Listener. AR Listener
manages the display of the augmented elements of the application having gathered all different
types of context data. It creates and initialises a “tracker” -ARToolkitPlus- object, indicates the
different markers ARToolkit has to detect in the captured image and takes under consideration
any input the user might provide in the meantime or any other input coming from the XML
parser or the sound manager.

Figure 4.12: Architecture of the 2nd AR prototype (illustration extracted from (Jouvin, 2007)
Interaction Subsystem: The interaction subsystem of the application is a module named
Interface Listener. This module gathers and processes any input that the user makes on purpose
when the 2D or 3D menus appear after the painting is detected while also controlling both the
ARSpace and the ScreenSpace viewports. The ScreenSpace viewport is also partially managed by
the CEGUI (Crazy Eddie's Guide User Interface), a plug-in used by Ogre3D for adding up all the

144

2D elements (buttons, display bar, images etc) and for associating a behaviour and function to
every event (click, double-click, mouse rollover etc.), either predefined (freeze, quit, etc.) or defined by
the user, using XML files.

The “predefined behaviours” are executed every time the guide is activated and can only be
programmed by an experimented programmer. An example of a predefined behaviour is the
“freeze” function and the display of multimedia files.
The “external behaviours” module allows the definition of behaviours outside the core engine
through modification of the XML files and is more accessible to content authors that are nonprogrammers. Some examples of external behaviours that can be defined using the XML language
are: the definition of an input device (joystick or mouse) or the definition of a particular action to
be taken once a 3D object is activated.
Presentation Subsystem: For the final rendering of the application, the core engine relies on
Ogre 3D, the 3D rendering engine of the application. When Ogre 3D is instantiated two scene
managers are needed, one for the ARSpace and one for the ScreenSpace (Figure 4.5). The
organisation of the "Scene Manager" can be modified by adding a new rendering system, like
Direct3D or OpenGL, or by providing another pool of data for example, an Internet site or a
database. This separation of the graph of the scene and the content is said to be one of the most
brilliant ideas of the Ogre 3D team. In order to interact with the scene, the two frame listeners,
AR Listener are Interface Listener are also added to the Ogre 3D root.
The most significant classes in Ogre 3D are:
a) "Scene Management": controls the content of the scene, its structure as well as the way and
angle by which it is seen by the camera.
b) "Resource Management": every 2D or 3D rendering necessitates resources that can be 3D
objects, textures, fonts etc. It is therefore important to control the way these elements are loaded,
the way they are used and the way they are manipulated if they are not needed.
c) "Rendering": refers to the final visualisation of the scene on the selected display. This part
concerns the lowest level of the rendering chain. The "Scene Management" cooperates with the
"Rendering" classes for the final rendering of all components of the scene.
Application authoring:

In order to facilitate the authoring of the AR applications, many

important and necessary parameters are passed to the core engine using XML files (Appendix III).

145

These are analyzed by the parser XERCES. Four different types of XML documents are used in
the application.
a) MagicEngineParameter.xml: This XML file contains data regarding the position and the
dimensions of the AR Space (the main frame) of the application but also the location of a separate
file containing information relevant with the calibration of the camera.
b) MagicEngineGUI.xml: This XML file contains data regarding the modes of selection and
activation of the different elements of the interface. All interface elements may appear either in the
viewport ARSpace and/or in the viewport ScreenSpace (Figure 4.5).
c) MagicEngineItem.xml: This document is the most important of the application as it includes all the
pointers to media and files that will be used for a particular painting presentation. For each
museum object included, one MagicEngineItem is necessary. After the definition of the tracking
method to be used, the location of the pattern to be detected is defined. Then what follows is the
description of the “augmentations” or widgets that will appear, once the painting is detected.
These graphic elements are grouped and can be of two types, either 3D objects (“3DObjects”) or
rectangles ("Frames") on which a texture can be applied. The attributes of both these categories
are “position”, “rotation” and “onAction”.
d) MagicEnginePresentation: This document is linked with the different types of presentations that
can be launched when a widget is activated. A presentation consists of a parade of different media
sequences (see also section 4.8.3).
The process followed in order to acquire, process and prepare the “raw” content that was used for
the application authoring is described in the next section.
4.8 PREPARING THE CONTENT

4.8.1 INTRODUCTION-DEFINING THE NOTION OF CONTENT

During the numerous meetings that took place with the author’s academic supervisors, other
members of the participating research unit of France Telecom R&D department and the museum
professionals (museum educators, curators, history of art professors), it became apparent that the
meaning attributed to “content” was not the same for all of the involved stakeholders. In terms of
computer science, especially in terms of virtual and AR environments, the word content is usually
related with the resources needed to author 3D content, like for example 3D objects, meshes, or
other “materials” needed to stitch a 3D-registered interactive application. For museum

146

professionals, on the other hand, the word “content” refers in most of the cases, to the actual
educational material that will be delivered through a multimedia application.
The preparation of the educational content that would be embedded in the application was one of
the most complex tasks of the full procedure. As at this phase of the project there was no
financing, neither an officially launched project (with the exception of this thesis project that
would be a kind of pilot for the forthcoming, two years and a half project), it was only possible to
count upon the availabilities and volunteering of the museum personnel. It is important to repeat
here, that the museum representatives ruled out the possibility of content creation without their
explicit involvement. At the same time it became pretty obvious that the first and most important
phase of content creation should take place in the museum, as it was not possible to treat
documentation material outside the museum premises.
Another very important factor regarding content creation was that at this stage of the project and
despite the fact of holding long discussions about mobile museum guides and the potential of
Augmented Reality, the museum had no past experience relevant with the experimentation. It was
therefore essential to join efforts so as to better comprehend the kind of information that could be
included, and in particular the kind of information that would be better revealed using the
Augmented Reality metaphor. The only plausible way to achieve that was by working closely with
the museum curator and educators in all phases of content creation.
The scenarios creation and the successive content authoring included two iterative phases: content
and scenario creation in the museum, and content and scenario creation in the lab.

4.8.2 CONTENT CREATION IN THE MUSEUM PREMISES

Regular meetings were organized in the museum between the author and the implicated museum
curator, who acted as a medium between the writer and the museum educators. The meetings
took place once or -at the most- twice a week, according to the availability of the museum
personnel. Meanwhile communication was established through email and phone calls.
The first step was to examine the documentation available for each painting meticulously. Despite
the fact that the museum uses different database systems for the documentation of their
collection, the full documentation records still reside in hard paper folders where all sort of
information gets gathered (Figure 4.13a-13b). The nature of this information is diverse, ranging
from available publications and bibliography concerning the painting, correspondence of the

147

museum with institutions and researchers regarding the painting, restoration interventions, even
examples of reproductions of the paintings used in a non museum context (Figure 4.14a-14b).

Figure 4.13: The physical archive of the Museum of Fine Arts and example of the folders used for the content
creation (courtesy of the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes)
The diversity of the available material gave many ideas as to the scenario and the content of the
commentaries for each work. One of the most characteristic examples comes from the
documentation folder of Lallemant’s “Saint Family”. The folder contains ultraviolet and infrared
photographs of the painting which show that there were posterior interventions in the painting.
That gave the idea of mapping the parts that had been repainted at a later date, onto the real
painting. In the case of “The woman in between two ages” the author was surprised to see that
the painting had been used as a cover for two books and a music CD (Figure 14a-14b). That gave
the idea that in a future presentation there could be a thematic section regarding the influence and
impact of the painting in the modern era. In another case, a visitor’s letter dating from the 1st
quarter of the 19th century was discovered and joined the museums’ documents collection.
Because of all these new, rich input as well as the diversity of the available documentation
material, museum professionals were advised to try to establish common thematic axes for all of
the presented paintings. The museum came up with the following thematic axes that finally
composed the available themes for each commented painting:
1.

Description, where a description of the painting would be provided, paying particular

attention to the iconographic elements that would facilitate the “decoding” of the depicted subject

148

2.

Technique, where observations regarding the technique employed for the creation of the

painting would be exposed
3.

Iconography, where more information about the iconography of the theme, or other

iconographic parallels (same theme, or other works of the same artist) would be available.
4.

Context, where the focus would be on the social, artistic and historical context of the

period in which the painting was created
5.

Artist, where relevant information about the artist biography would be provided

Figure 4.14: example of resources “discovered” in the museum archives, providing scenario ideas for the application
content.
Once the themes were available, the work with the physical archive started. All available material
was consulted and commented regarding suitability to the selected public. At first, texts were
composed by the museum curator on the basis of a discussion regarding the archive “findings”.
The author suggested ideas and established lists of material (e.g. documents, photos) for
digitization in order to transfer them to the lab where the second phase of content creation would
take place. However as time went by, and mutual understanding and trust was built, the author
was allowed to play an even more active role in content creation, composing texts and then
submitting them to the museum curator. In addition, the Picasso painting greatly benefited from
multimedia content, prepared by the museum educators especially for the new AR prototype.

4.8.3 SCENARIO CREATION, NAVIGATION SCHEMES AND CONTENT AUTHORING IN THE
LAB

The material prepared was then transferred to the lab where a new authoring process took place.
At the beginning the provided by the curator texts were examined, together with the available
illustrations in order to obtain some first ideas regarding scenarios of presentation. Should the
textual information obtained by the museum be presented as text or as audio? Would a text with
images be transformed in a simple slideshow or an “augmented” one? Which were the painting
elements to highlight and present in 3D and which ones in 2D?
2D and 3D slideshows were subsequently prepared, additional photographic material was when
necessary demanded, while many audio sequences had to be recorded. This process was iterative;
as soon as the first scenarios were ready, they were once again submitted to the museum for
validation and subsequently transferred for modifications in the lab (Figure 4.15).

Figure 4.15: To the right, the iterative design process followed and relations between all three AR prototypes, to the
left graph of the ISO 13407 (ISO, 1999) standard.
Regarding navigation in the content of the application, one particular design was retained,
susceptible to be consistent but also provide “affordances” (Norman, 1990): this navigation
scheme used the thematic axes proposed by the museum professional for navigation at a 1st level,
and pictograms of the available type of media below each thematic axis, for navigation in a second
level. Eventually, at a third level, the visitor would find controls for forwarding or rewinding a
multimedia presentation. The different media available in the guide were:

150

Simple text: an effort was made to keep texts short and legible on the UMPC screen.
Audio: parts of text would be recorded so as to provide the visitor with audio
comments.
Video: despite the effort to find several video sequences, only one video was found
appropriate enough to be included
Still images, serving as reference images comparing the work of art with other related
works.
Slideshows: slideshows would be used to “augment” the actual paintings with details
or other reference and comparison images, either in 2D or in 3D.
Animation slideshows, capturing the attention of the visitor in a more entertaining
way.
The navigation scheme that resulted from this procedure is illustrated in the mockup presented
below in Figure 4.17 and in the scheme of Figure 4.16.One of the first things to be checked out
was the visual metaphors that would be used for presenting the content. The first intention was to
try to find images that would visually convey the content of each theme. For some of the themes,
this seemed possible. For some other however, as the “iconography” theme or the “technique”
theme, this proved to be much more difficult. The result was not judged satisfactory. The icons
were therefore replaced by 3D ovals with inlayed text. Representing the available media, below
each theme, was an easier task. Icons that make allusion to audio, video, text or slideshow are far
easier to understand by a wide public. In Figure 4.17, we see a mockup with the different thematic
axes available for the anonymous 16th century painting.

Figure 4.16: Navigation scheme of the mobile AR guide.

151

When the visitor decides to activate the theme “artist”, images corresponding to the nature of the
available information will be displayed. In the case of the example below, under the theme artist,
there is one audio comment, text, a slideshow and a video (Figure 4.17).

Figure 4.17: Mockup demonstrating the navigation scheme adopted for all paintings
After reviewing and validating the presentation scenarios and preparing all the elementary
presentation media (audios, texts, video, slideshows or animated presentations), the actual content
authoring had to take place.
As previously seen, in the architecture section (4.7.4), the AR application contains a module that
allows the authoring of educational scenarios using XML files. For each painting, a
MagicEngineItem.XML file is created (an example is provided in Appendix III). Apart containing
information for the pattern to be detected, this XML file provides also a description of all
available themes and their corresponding multimedia presentations. The XML file, first defines
the 3D objects to be created once the painting is detected, corresponding to the five available
themes, “description”, “technique”, “iconography”, “context” and “artist”. Then the XML
document defines which virtual objects appear when a theme is activated. These objects represent
metaphors as to the nature of the available resources and are linked with other XML files
containing the type of presentation and its physical address (Appendix III). During all phases of

152

content authoring, several visits in the museum were necessary in order to fine-tune the
application and ensure its robustness and its stability.
4.9 A WALKTHROUGH IN THE FINAL AR APPLICATION

The visitor holds the UMPC with both hands and “scans” the surrounding environment, in this
case one of the museum galleries exhibiting paintings. The camera with which the UMPC is
equipped captures the video of the real scene which is used as a real-time background of the
application. The application recognizes the paintings that are commented and annotates them with
a question mark pictogram. When the user approaches the commented work of art, an audio alert
is heard and a menu appears around the painting, consisting of five 3D objects, each representing
one of the five available themes, “description”, “technique”, “iconography”, “context” and
“artist” (Figure 4.18). The visitor is provided with the possibility to use a “freeze” button (pause in
the application) that will make the camera use the last captured frame as a background. This
possibility was provided so that the visitors do not have to constantly point the camera to the
paintings, holding the UMPC in an uncomfortable position.

Figure 4.18: Examples of the navigation scheme employed for the paintings

153

Using the joystick of the UMPC, the visitor can navigate from one theme to another. When one
of the five themes is selected, a new menu appears, with the form of images, each representing a
medium (audio, text, video or slideshow). A back button for return to the previous level is also
provided. The visitor can then activate the desired presentation. All types of presentations can be
presented in a series of sequences. The visitor can go forwards and backwards within these
sequences using the joystick. When a sequence has ended, the submenu appears once again. The
visitor, using the “back” button, can navigate back to the themes level. The navigation scheme and
the interface employed for the final prototype is demonstrated in Figure 4.18.
4.9 SUMMARY-CONCLUSIONS

This chapter presented the procedure followed for the design and implementation of two mobile
museum guide prototypes based on the AR metaphor and using mobile AR technologies and
tools. Both prototypes benefited from the definition of a list of 29 possible functions, further
classified in four distinct categories.
The chapter also presented the ways by which the initial prototype, though modest, served in
order to approach the local museum and propose a common project and looked into the different
stakeholder motivations and needs. The setting of the main study, the Museum of Fine Arts in
Rennes, was also presented, before exposing the complex process of content creation in terms of
educational scenarios and application authoring. The main components and the architecture of the
application were also visited as well as the mechanisms by which the application authoring took
place. Finally, the navigation and interaction scheme that resulted both from the process of
content creation in the museum premises and the computer lab as well as the resulting application
structure was also examined.
The next chapter will particularly focus on methodological issues regarding the evaluation of the
AR guide in the museum premises and will also explain the procedure through which the
evaluation protocol took shape.

CHAPTER 5
METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATION AND DATA
COLLECTION

5.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter completes the previous one by describing the way evaluation was planned, set up and
carried out in collaboration with all of the involved stakeholders. Though the content of this
chapter is substantially a part of the iterative design process, its complexity and importance,
regarding the main research hypothesis, implied a separate presentation.
This new section presents the state of the art regarding evaluation for mobile guides in the
museum setting and proposes a systematic taxonomy for the evaluation of related projects. The
project-specific requirements, resulting from the AR character of the museum guide, are then
presented, as well as their impact on the evaluation methodology and the evaluation protocol
retained. Based on the proposed evaluation taxonomy, the methodology that shaped the main
research questions is presented. The adopted evaluation protocol is then examined, before passing
on to the section presenting in detail the task and experimental setup employed for the on-site
experimentations.

5.2 EVALUATION FOR MOBILE GUIDES IN THE MUSEUM SETTING

5.2.1 WHY TO EVALUATE

Evaluation regarding the introduction of mobile guides in the museum setting is a concrete issue
that has hopefully – and unlike other areas in human computer interaction - been accredited
sufficient interest and importance among the related scientific community (Kelly, 2002). The main
reasons for that have been already exposed in section 2.5 where human, economical and
technological barriers were identified and discussed, but will be briefly reminded here.
The design, implementation and maintenance of a portable multimedia guide are time- and
resources-consuming processes. Few "off-the-shelf" solutions exist and therefore museums
together with IT companies have to start from scratch in order to create a mobile multimedia
guide. An interdisciplinary approach and an iterative design process are therefore needed in which,

155

ideally, information technology specialists, museum curators, educators and visitors should
participate. The necessary infrastructure in terms of hardware and software and its maintenance is
another issue that raises the cost and the risk of related interventions, and one that calls on early
evaluation, though recent experiences have shown that in the future visitors could use their own
devices to download the necessary applications (Samis and Pau, 2006).
At the same time, the very nature of the museum, where the exhibitions has long been thought to
constitute the major form of pedagogy (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994, Hooper-Greenhill, 2000) makes
evaluation and assessment a prerequisite, in order to ensure that the guide and its multimedia
content will not be used –as museum professionals often fear (von Lehn and Heath, 2003)- in a
distractive, “tv-like” manner, but will indeed help the visitor in making meaningful links between
the actual exhibits and the interpretation material with no fragmentation of attention (Aoki et al.,
2001). As museums are open to a wide public of different ages, backgrounds and needs, evaluation
is also very useful in tailoring not only the content but also its structure and presentation to
different museum visitors profiles. Last, but not least, evaluation studies can help IT and museum
stakeholders in the establishment of best practice and reference resources for other cultural
heritage institutions internationally (Damala and Kockelkorn, 2006).

5.2.2 HOW TO EVALUATE

The mobile human computer interaction community has lately developed a vivid interest for
ethnography and ethnomethodology as it becomes more and more apparent that the context of
use of mobile devices and services is equally -if not more- important than the device and the
proposed applications themselves (Blom et al., 2005, Dourish, 2001, Gonord and Menrath, 2005,
Tamminem et al., 2003, Galani, 2005).
As important as this evolution might have proved in other areas of mobile human computer
interaction, in our case it might be misleading to further insist on the theoretical background of
this approach. Ethnomethodology, psychology, sociology but also market research-theory and
approaches have longtime now been integrated in museum studies, and visitor studies more in
particular (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994). It would therefore be no exaggeration to suggest that
museum professionals could teach a great deal to their IT stakeholders if they were aware of the
potential of reshaping already existing knowledge from visitor studies and museum learning
theories (Damala, 2007b). This remark is also very clearly illustrated in Figure 5.1, which presents
side by side a model of the ISO 13407 standard (ISO, 1999) and a graph representing the three

156

main phases of museum-exhibition development (design phase, implementation phase and
development phase) (Grewcock, 2002).
Evaluation activities related with the introduction of multimedia and interactive applications
created for museum documentation or interpretation purposes can also be considered to exercise
an influence on the methods used for the evaluation of mobile museum guides (Economou, 1998,
Economou, 1999). Finally influences can also be detected in evaluation practices and guidelines
employed in the field of computer supported learning and in the field of interaction with mobile
devices and services (Nielsen et al., 2006, Been-Lirn Duh et al., 2006, Love, 2005).

5.2.3 WHEN TO EVALUATE

Three main types of evaluation can be distinguished: front-end evaluation that occurs during the
very early stages of a multimedia project, formative evaluation, that takes place during the
development and production of a project, and finally summative evaluation that follows the
completion of a project (Frechtling-Westat et al., 2002). With regards to the creation of mobile
multimedia museum guides, summative evaluation is conducted in the majority of projects’
evaluation (Table 5.1).

5.2.4 EVALUATION METHODS

Once an evaluation type is chosen, the appropriate methodology needs to be selected. Two main
approaches can be distinguished: qualitative evaluation methods and quantitative evaluation
methods. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods have different strengths and weaknesses
that one should take under consideration before choosing which methods are best suited for the
purpose. Questionnaires, surveys, tests and data logs make part of quantitative evaluation
methods, while interviews, focus groups, observation, tests and the use of visitors’ impression
book belong to qualitative evaluation methods. However, it is important to keep in mind that in
reality all forms of data gathering may result in qualitative or quantitative results (Preece et al.,
2007).
Surveys and questionnaires are good for gathering descriptive data, are relatively inexpensive and
can be analyzed using a variety of software. They can provide a good general picture but they
usually lack depth. Interviews can yield a richest and more in depth data but they are time
consuming and difficult to transcribe and analyze (Frechtling-Westat et al., 2002). Focus groups
are good for generating new ideas and for brainstorming sessions as well as for clarifying
quantitative findings, even though one of the drawbacks could be that group interaction could be

157

limited or non productive (Kuniavsky, 2003). Observation is suitable for identifying unanticipated
outcomes but is expensive and time consuming, needs trained personnel and a good observational
coding form (Love, 2005). Tests are thought to be efficient when gathering information on the
status of knowledge (or the change in the status of knowledge). Finally, data logs can reveal
patterns of behaviour and provide answers to very interesting questions regarding the duration of
a visit, visitors’ favourite multimedia sequences and adopted navigation schemes (Kuniavsky,
2003).

ISO standard 13407(Figure 4.15a)
5.2.5 EVALUATION METHODOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENT OF MOBILE MUSEUM GUIDES

How does evaluation take place in the museum, when mobile multimedia guides are put on the
benchmark? A thorough literature review was undertaken in order to shed light on the
methodologies employed in relevant projects and the research questions related. The findings were

158

first presented in the 3rd AVICOM International Museology Conference in 2006 (Damala and
Kockelkorn, 2006b), in the form of a comparative table, reproduced here, in order to facilitate the
comparisons regarding the type of the evaluation conducted (front-end, formative, summative),
the methods used to collect the data (observation, questionnaires, log files, focus group etc), the
evaluation/research questions, as well as the size of the sample.
As we can see in Table 5.1, where some of the most representative evaluated mobile museum
guide projects are presented, despite the risks involved in the development of a mobile museum
guide, summative evaluation is conducted in the majority of the cases. Mixed-method evaluation
sessions are usually conducted though –as expected- qualitative methods seem to be employed
when the sample is relatively small and quantitative methods when the sample is large. However it
is important to point out that even informal evaluation conducted with a small number of
participants may yield interesting results that can at a later phase be used in order to plan more
structured and organized evaluation sessions. This is also due to the fact that the niche domain of
design and implementation of mobile museum guides is relatively new and so far no exhaustive list
of research questions seems to exist (Exploratorium, 2001, Exploratorium, 2005, Damala and
Kockelkorn 2006b).

5.2.6 THE NOTION OF EFFECTIVENESS

The various studies conducted so far for the evaluation of mobile, multimedia museum guides,
treat several aspects, as diverse as navigation, interaction, usability, ergonomics, learning (Bartneck
et al., 2006),user characteristics or localization. The goal in all cases seems to be measuring the
effectiveness of applications designed for mobile multimedia museum guides. But what does
effectiveness really mean and how many forms can it take?
In the experimentations that took place in the Genoa’s Costa Aquarium the goals set were to
measure pleasure and usability as well as ease of use, enjoyability, general usefulness, value,
fragmentation of attention and knowledge acquisition (Bellotti et al., 2002). In Filoli, an historical
house in Woodside, California, evaluation was conducted in order to measure the “attentional
balance” in between three different entities, the guidebook, other visiting companions and the
exposed object (Aoki et al., 2001). The Muse project implementation for “Il Museo e Certosa di
San Martino” in Naples set out as a goal to measure general user satisfaction, the multimedia
design content, the ergonomics and the usability of the navigation and the interaction design
(Galasso et al., 2004).

In the Marble Museum of Carrara in Italy evaluation was conducted to measure the impact of the
quantity and quality of the information provided, the modalities of the content presentation, the
interaction with the handheld devices, and the capacity of visitors to orientate themselves in the

160

museum (Ciavarella and Paternò, 2004). One of the most extensive evaluation efforts has been
carried out by Tate Modern, in London; the goal was to validate the content design and the
modalities of interaction, navigation and interface design as well as to measure the length and ease
of use (Proctor and Burton, 2003, Wilson, 2004). Another very extensive evaluation session was
conducted by the Jean Paul Getty Museum, which implemented a mobile guide on the occasion of
the temporary exhibition of Rembrandt’s late religious portraits (Hart, October 2005). The results
were published in October 2005 and were relevant with usefulness, accessibility, ease of use,
interface, content quality and navigation. The sample consisted of more than 4000 visitors. The
Exploratorium, a popular science museum in San Francisco, USA that has been one of the first
institutions to experiment with mobile, multimedia guides has also released studies concerning the
use of mobile handheld devices in the museum premises and has already organized two forums on
that subject (Exploratorium, 2001, Exploratorium, 2005, Hsi, 2002). The Dinohunter suite,
implemented for the Senckenberg Paleontological Museum in Frankfurt, evaluated the usability,
the interface, the navigation and ergonomics of the proposed mobile application (Sauer and
Goebel, 2003). For the last project examined, the Mobivisit guide that was implemented for the
Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon, evaluation examined aspects such as interface, geolocalization,
interaction, navigation and content structure (Damala et al., 2005).

5.2.7 A TAXONOMY FOR THE EVALUATION OF MOBILE MUSEUM GUIDES

Still, as we can also see from the table, it is very difficult to establish a taxonomy for the evaluation
points that would be candidate to be assessed in related projects. It is for this reason that, while
planning the evaluation sessions to be conducted in the Museon museum, in the Netherlands
(section 2.4), an effort was undertaken to establish a taxonomy grill of common evaluation issues
appearing in every mobile museum guide project, as part of the PhD research project undertaken
by the author.
This first proposed taxonomy was presented during the Mobile HCI Conference that took place in
2006 in Finland (Damala and Kockelkorn, 2006b). The main points of this contribution were the
following. First that in the case of mobile museum guide projects, evaluation needs to be
conducted not only with the main target group of the application, meaning museum visitors, but
also with all the staff involved in the creation, implementation, design and distribution of a mobile
multimedia guide, namely museum and IT professionals. The second contribution was the
distinction of three categories under which evaluation points can be grouped: technological
evaluation points, information impact evaluation points and logistics/administration evaluation
points. The third point comes as a consequence of the first two, implying that all three types of

161

evaluation points can be examined from the point of view of museum visitors, museum
professionals and IT companies. Let’s now have a closer look at the three categories of evaluation
key points (Table 5.2).
Table 5.2: The initial evaluation points classification grid

Technology-related evaluation points are strongly linked with choices made regarding the actual
software and hardware used to design, implement, and deliver multimedia applications for
museum handheld guides. In this case, evaluation with museum staff should include evaluation
questions relevant with the content implementation, the effectiveness of the chosen way for
content distribution (either remotely or locally stored), the geolocalization modules, in case they
exist to help with visitors’ orientation and, finally, the content delivery and adaptation to
potentially different platforms and available bandwidths. Technological evaluation points must
also be assessed with museum visitors. Under this category the issues classified were the usability
and ease of use of a proposed application, the overall user interface, including navigation,
multimedia and interaction design, the recovery of the system after a potential crash,
personalization, ergonomics (such as the use of stripes or headphones), the positioning and
messaging system and the system’s accessibility.
Information impact evaluation points are relevant with the impact of introducing a mobile
multimedia guide in the museum environment. From the museum’s point of view the choice of
the technology, mentioned above, is very much related with the process of content creation and

162

content update as well as with the creation of user groups and profiles. Information Impact
evaluation points are more numerous when examining the visitors’ side. Here, one of the main
evaluation points is the content quality, structure and design, standalone as well as in relation to
the exhibition. Usability, enjoyability, usefulness and user satisfaction is another group of points
often examined in evaluation sessions. Distraction and attentional balance as described by Aoki et
al. (Aoki et al., 2001) falls under this category as well as learning, knowledge acquisition and
visitors’ isolation.
Finally the third category groups evaluation points relevant with administration/logistics issues.
Regarding the museum professionals, evaluation needs to be conducted in relation to
maintainability. Maintainability covers aspects such as battery life and recharging, updating older
versions of the multimedia applications, security, not only of the devices but of the overall
museum information system, as well as distribution and recovery of the terminals after the end of
each session. Other important issues to examine are the number of devices or terminals needed as
well as the number of employees needed to handle the distribution and the recovery of the
devices. Distribution and registration process needs also to be evaluated with visitors in order to
see if the full process of getting and using a mobile device is smooth and not time- and energyconsuming.

5.2.8 THE EVALUATION TAXONOMY REVISITED

Despite of the concrete usefulness of this first taxonomy approach, put on paper during the
DANAE project in order to plan the evaluation session that would follow before the project
completion, it soon became obvious that certain ameliorations could be made to this scheme as to
its essence and the employed onomatology
The first important modification that renders the taxonomy itself easier to understand and use is
related with the 2nd category that was renamed “Interactive Content” (instead of “Information
Impact”). This name makes more sense, as it distinguishes more clearly the difference between
evaluation issues related with the technologies used for the design, implementation and delivery of
the application and the actual interactive content evaluated. The name of the other two categories
remained the same.
Another important differentiation is related with the involved stakeholders. A new category was
added to the already existing three categories, museum visitors, museum professionals and IT
stakeholders. The new category caters for the role of sponsors often enough involved in related
projects. For example, Bloomberg has been the sponsor for the Tate Modern Multimedia Tour in

163

London (on site visit, July 27, 2008), and Korean Air, the main sponsor of the new multimedia
guide of the Louvre (Louvre, 2008). Further on, as it is easy to understand by viewing the new
taxonomy (Table 5.4), the effort to link stakeholders with particular evaluation points/or issues
was dropped, as the majority of the identified evaluation issues can be matched with one of the
four related stakeholders, depending on the nature of each mobile museum guide project.
Finally, all evaluation issues/points, of all three categories have been reviewed and most
importantly enriched with new issues identified. Though a major effort was made to place
evaluation issues only under the most corresponding category, sometimes this task is very hard if
not impossible to achieve. For example usability, can be examined under several aspects, such as
the content creation or the content update and the interactive content delivered to the visitors, but
can also be related with the logistics/administration process, if we seek to explore how easily the
museum personnel charged with the distribution of the guide, can accomplish the tasks of
handling and distributing the devices.
In order to resume the proposed taxonomy after its reformation and enrichment, and before
moving forward in examining project-specific issues that influenced the evaluation methodology,
let’s just sum up the most important facts as to the proposed scheme:
Three categories of evaluation issues are more than susceptible to arise during a mobile museum
guide evaluation process, be it front-end, formative or summative: The first category is related
with the technologies chosen for the implementation of the guide. They embrace various aspects
ranging from the capacities of the platform chosen for the delivery, to the application and content
implementation: Who develops the application? Does this person have to be specialized? How the
actual content is created and how long does that take? Can this task be performed by museum
professionals or will they need assistance? How robust the different components of the guide to
be manipulated are? How is the content updated? This first category is more related with museum
and IT professionals but the answers could be of importance for a potential sponsor, while they
have a serious impact on the other two categories.
The 2nd category, renamed “Interactive Content” groups issues that should be mainly evaluated
with museum visitors, though front-end evaluation with museum and IT professionals would also
make sense. As the name implies the evaluation issues here are relevant with the actual content
delivered, its quality, its duration, the ease of use, but also the way it is actually used by visitors
when they try to get some insights about exposed objects, while moving and trying to navigate and

164

orientate themselves in the museum space and in the mobile, accompanying, multimedia
application.
Finally, the 3rd category groups evaluation issues related with logistics and administration aspects.
Who distributes the devices? Will they be given free of charge or will there be a fee? Does the
visitor have to leave a deposit? How robust are the devices? Which is the duration of the battery
life? Do devices need to be maintained and how often? What is the interrelation with other IT
applications used in the museum? Does the existing infrastructure satisfy the application
requirements? All issues of all three categories are listed in Table 5.4, proposing a pool for forming
evaluation and/or research questions.
5.3 PLANNING THE AR GUIDE EVALUATION

In the previous section, we examined several issues related with the use and evaluation of mobile
multimedia guides in the museum setting and demonstrated the underlying relations with other
disciplines, while introducing a taxonomy of evaluation issues susceptible to arise when evaluating
mobile museum guidance systems. However, there exists another important parameter that had to
be taken under account for the experimentations: benchmarking the research hypothesis that AR
could be used as a principal component for the design and the implementation of an interactive
mobile multimedia museum guide. Seen under this perspective, the application to be evaluated
falls not only under the category of mobile museum guides applications but also under the
category of mobile AR applications.

5.3.1 AR RELATED METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Though AR has been studied for nearly four decades now, it is only recently that research started
to focus more on evaluation and HCI issues (Dunser et al., 2008, Swan and Gabbard, 2005,
Dunser et al., 2007, Grasset et al., 2007b). It is probably for this reason that AR has been
characterized as being “technology-driven”(Anastassova et al., 2007b, Dunser et al., 2007), and AR
systems as being “technology-centric” (Swan and Gabbard, 2005).
One of the main reasons for that is that AR is an emerging technology (Anastassova et al., 2007a,
Anastassova et al., 2007b, Gabbard and Swan, 2008, Haller et al., 2007), and as such, does not
boast established design guidelines, heuristics or fixed and well accepted interaction metaphors.
This last remark is also due to the fact that AR has not yet defined specific or standardized
interfaces (Dunser et al., 2007, Wagner, 2007). Some researchers even doubt about whether this
will ever be done, due to the variety of the devices and interfaces used for Augmented Reality

165

applications (Bowman et al., 2005, Dunser et al., 2007). It is illustrative that up till today, none of
the already proposed AR systems has made a huge market success (Wagner, 2007).
The lack of design guidelines and standardized dedicated delivery-platforms is not the only
problematic issue in the domain of AR technologies. As we already saw in chapter 3, AR suffers
also from the lack of dedicated advanced authoring tools not only for tracking and pose
estimation but also for content creation (Haller et al., 2007). This fact forces developers and
engineers to spend considerable amounts of time in creating a single version of an experience that
cannot be evaluated until all technology is put in place, an appropriate and robust platform is
selected and content is authored (Dunser et al., 2007). The rapid prototyping and the iterative
design process employed in other disciplines of software and interaction design is thus prohibited
(Gandy et al., 2007). On the other hand, it has been argued that when low- or mid-fidelity AR
prototypes are used for evaluation purposes, end-users risk to underperform (Anastassova et al.,
2007a).
Hopefully, these deadlocks have recently started to draw the attention among the HCI and AR
communities. Two publications are of particular interest and will be briefly commented here in
chronological order, as they provide an overview of past and current practices regarding the field
of AR, evaluation and human centered design. The 1st study was published in 2005 by Swan and
Gabbard (Swan and Gabbard, 2005). These two researchers examined a representative sample of
266 publications related with AR, published between 1998 and 2004. By reviewing this filtered
pool of articles, they found out that only 38 (~14%) addressed some issue of HCI and only 21
(~8%) described a formal user-based study. The 2nd study was published in September 2008 by
HITLab in New Zealand (Dunser et al., 2008). Among 557 AR related publications published
between 1993 and 2007, only an estimated 10% was found to include some type of user
evaluation.
These percentages are rather illustrative as to the state of the art in evaluating AR technologies and
applications. They also partially explain why the end-user is most of the times integrated at the
very last stages of a project (Dunser et al., 2007). However, other reasons have also been
identified, such as incorrect motivations for proposing AR applications (Dunser et al., 2008), the
lack of education on how to evaluate AR experiences, or the lack of understanding of the need for
conducting evaluation. It is therefore not surprising that even in the context of more popular than the museum environment- AR-specific domains (such as industry or assemblage), actual
empirical results do not consistently report on the benefits of using AR over more traditional job
aids (Anastassova et al., 2007a).

166

But other reasons can also be identified. As we also had the possibility to experience during the
early stages of the design of the AR guide for the museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, even when the
end-users and other stakeholders are early enough implicated in the design process, they
demonstrate difficulties in expressing their needs in terms of AR scenarios (Damala et al., 2008),
or are barely aware of potential applications (Anastassova et al., 2007b) as the term AR is far from
being widely used. This fact has led some researchers in employing the term “ill-defined” for the
description of the process of user task-analysis in AR applications (Anastassova et al., 2007b,
Haller et al., 2007, Sandor and Klinker, 2007).
All these issues have been so far resulting in a vicious circle, which risks prohibiting the adoption
of AR applications in the long term. In an article of 2002, treating usability engineering with
regards to AR, Gabbard and Swan (Gabbard et al., 2002) stress out that usability in AR
applications is as important as in any other kind of interactive systems and that in order to
attribute to a system high usability, the latter has to be both useful and usable. Some AR
experimentations however have so far demonstrated some limitations regarding either the first or
the second attribute. Giving the possibility to a person to remotely caress a hen equipped with a
special jacket (Lee et al., 2006) might present several challenges as a potential application
technologically speaking, but risks to raise questions as to whether the application is useful or not.
On the other hand, visiting an archeological site equipped with a wearable AR system that
superimposes reconstructions of ruined temples is quite useful (Sforza et al., 2001, Gleue and
Daehne, 2001, Vlahakis et al., 2002) but not usable if the equipment is bulky and heavy, the user
has to wear a head mounted display and the external temperature under shadow exceeds the 38° C
degrees. In both examples, it is not the technological achievements that are put under question but
their degree of usability.

5.3.2 CURRENT PRACTICES IN AR EVALUATION

Some of the major reasons for the underutilization of evaluation regarding AR applications are
now more understandable and have been exposed. Underutilized or not, it would be useful to
examine tendencies in the evaluation of AR applications, in order to spot possible research future
directions. Three articles are of particular interest, as they provide an overview of evaluation
techniques and methods in AR.
The first paper examined is (Anastassova et al., 2007a). Anastassova examined 48 articles related
with user-centered design and evaluation in AR industrial applications. The criteria the articles had
to meet in order to be included in the survey were to treat an aspect of human-centered design

167

and to include empirical results. The fact of examining and publishing in the same study articles
that employ user needs and task analysis as well as usability evaluations seems to be due to the fact
that only a small number of AR research studies treat user-centered design principles and
evaluation issues. Anastassova reported that the majority of the articles (83%) treated usability
issues and only 8 (~17%) presented user needs-analysis. She also found out that in this last
category the goal is usually to address “conscious” user needs (~63%) rather than “unconscious”
ones. In terms of methodology, she affirms that the studies aiming to examine already specific
needs use mainly interviews with task experts, quick field analysis of future users activity and
questionnaires, while the studies aiming to shed light on unclear user requirements are mostly
based on prototypes and scenarios’ evaluation. As to the articles dealing with usability evaluation,
which represent the greater percentage (83%), the goal most of the times is to evaluate the ease of
use of AR interfaces and their effectiveness for training, though the latter appears less often than
the former. The number of participants in the examined experimentations ranged from 1 to 75,
with the average being 15. Another very important remark is that usually the experimental tasks
are “artificial, simple and of short duration” and only 18% of the studies that were reviewed tried
to place the potential users in a real-conditions experimental setting. Anastassova concludes that
there is clearly “a lack of structured methodology to analyze user needs and to evaluate existing
technological solutions” and points out that user needs-analysis is “a challenge for emerging
technologies…because innovation is upcoming and in search of potential applications”
(Anastassova et al., 2007b).
The need for the employment of user-based studies regarding the creation of AR applications and
interactive experiences was also underlined by Gabbard and Swan in a recent, posterior to our
experimentations article, published in May 2008 (Gabbard and Swan, 2008). The authors stress out
from the very beginning that user-based studies can provide valuable insight for emerging
technologies, fundamentally altering the way humans perceive the world, such as AR. They also
claim that the integration of usability engineering and user-based studies in the AR research
agenda qualifies not only as an important challenge but also as a research opportunity.
Gabbard and Swan have also proposed a scheme for the classification of user-based
experimentations related with AR (Gabbard et al., 2002). They distinguished three,
complementary, axes.
1.

User based studies related with issues of human perception in AR (e.g. depth

perception, hand-eye coordination and speed of task performance).

168

2.

User based studies related with task performance within specific AR application

domains (e.g. target finding, time to task-completion, number of task errors)
3.

User based studies related with AR collaborative environments and computer-

supportive cooperative work.
Despite the fact that the authors describe these axes as complementary, if we try to place the
experimentation of the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes in this scheme, we will see that it can very
difficultly fit in any of these categories. The proposed prototype does not have (at least for the
time being) a collaborative character while the first research axis is not applicable in the context of
an interactive museum experience. And though the mobile AR enabled guide is closer to the 2nd
axis, hardly any of the tasks proposed to the museum visitor is measurable in terms of task-errors
or task completion time.
Wanting to cure this gap, Dunser et al. (Dunser et al., 2008), recently (September 2008) proposed
an extension by adding a 4th category, that they named “AR interfaces or system usability studies”,
by precising that these studies “don’t necessarily involve measurement of user task performances
but other ways of identifying issues with system usability”. This 4th category provides a more
suitable framework for the type of experimentations that would be conducted in the case of our
museum guide. It is important to notice at this point, that from the 161 articles classified in this
study, 25,4% falls in this 4th axis but only 8% (13 articles) present formal user evaluations.
This finding is also reflected on a series of other papers, not reviewed by this survey, but by the
author, due to the relevance of the domain context, enlarged to include not only museum or art
installations but also edutainment applications related with AR. The “invisible train” project is said
to have received between 5.000 and 6.000 visitors (Wagner, 2007). However, the results reported
were quite poor, as no formal evaluation, even with a smaller sample, was foreseen. During one of
the last phases of the ARCHEOGUIDE project (section 3.6.3) approximately 200 visitors tested
the AR archeological guide at the site of ancient Olympia in Greece. The reported results were
interesting but it is not certain that there were also representative, as no quantification even of
qualitative findings was presented (Vlahakis et al., 2005). The Black Magic kiosk featuring an AR
book was installed in an exhibition in New Zealand, visited by more than 400.000 people over six
months (Woods et al., 2004). Again, the researchers gained some valuable insight they combined
with other similar experiences regarding augmented objects in the museum setting, but the
informal way of collecting the data makes generalizations very difficult.

169

Finally, apart proposing a 4th research axis for AR evaluation and user-based studies, Dunser et al.
(Dunser et al., 2008) also proposed a taxonomy according to the evaluation methodology
employed. Five categories have been distinguished:
1.

Objective measurements, where measures should be interpreted with the strict

sense of the term (e.g. task completion time, accuracy, error rates).
2.

Subjective measurements, or perceived user ratings, usually gathered by the use of

questionnaires
3.

Qualitative analysis, which includes formal user observations, formal interviews or

classification or coding of user behavior (e.g. speech or gesture coding)
4.

Usability evaluation techniques, that employ expert based evaluation, task analysis,

heuristics or the “think aloud” method.
5.

Informal evaluations, including observation or other types of informal collection or

feedback.
However, one of the problems of this taxonomy, as the authors themselves have admitted, is that
researchers often use a wide variety of methods. In addition, to our opinion, the lines cannot be
easily drawn among all of the five proposed categories. For example, in which category should one
place an informal evaluation based on observation that is video recorded and a posteriori analyzed
and in which participants have been encouraged to use the “think-aloud” method? We believe,
that for the needs of our study, the “traditional” differentiation between qualitative and
quantitative methods as already analyzed in section 5.2.4 is sufficient.
To conclude, though the literature related with AR applications and experiences evaluation is still
not very rich, the research community seems to become more and more aware of the need for
evaluation and user-based studies. When evaluation is carried out, it is more often effectuated at
an advanced stage (formative evaluation), more often in the laboratory than in the real context of
use, and usually for simple or short duration tasks. Evaluation in the real application domain
environment is rarer as well as user needs-analysis, most usually carried out with domain experts.
Also, it seems that there also exists a paradox, with more evaluation studies for AR either focusing
on the use of “objective measurements”, difficult if not impossible to apply in the context of the
museum visit, or when this is not applicable (like for example in edutainment applications)
towards informal experimentation and evaluation. Consequently, and especially regarding AR for
edutainment and culture, the blurred and troubled scenery concerning design guidelines is even
more uncertain.

170

5.3.3 EMERGING AR SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

Given the current state of the art regarding evaluation in the AR domain, it could be interesting to
try to resume and briefly present some results and suggestions that -though still fragmentarypresent good chances for turning into AR specific guidelines. As with the previous section, this
presentation will also be of use regarding current limitations and gaps regarding HCI in AR
applications, which has only fragmentarily been explored in the AR context (Dunser et al., 2007).
The first question that arises when talking about guidelines for AR systems is whether general
GUI guidelines can be applied to AR systems. Dunser et al. suggest that the problem with this
approach is that GUI evaluation guidelines take most of the times as a prerequisite an interaction
with a screen, a mouse and a keyboard, while AR proposes several other diverse means for
interaction (input and output) with an application (Dunser and Hornecker, 2007). The same team
of researchers suggested as a direction the use of knowledge derived by VR, which in comparison
with AR has been so far more focused on evaluation (Roussou, 2004, Roussou, 2008). As in
contrast with this statement, we believe that as with GUI, Virtual Reality is radically different in
nature from AR, as in the former the user is completely emerged in an artificial, 3D environment.
Of course this affirmation cannot be but depending on the initial definition somebody attributes
to Virtual Reality. If for example the definition is flexible enough to include environments such as
Second Life, then indeed, some existing guidelines might also be applicable in AR applications.
As we already saw in section 5.3.1, Gabbard et al (Gabbard et al., 2002) discussed the issue of
usability and usability engineering for AR systems. For them a product with high usability has to
be both useful and usable. They also went further by defining that as with other interactive
applications, usability embraces several user oriented characteristics, among which the more
important are:
-

Ease of Learning

-

Speed of User Task performance

-

User Error Rate

-

Subjective User Satisfaction

-

User Retention Over Time

They also insist on the role of domain analysis for AR applications, prior to the beginning of a
project, defined as an activity that seeks to explore who are the users and the tasks they will

171

perform. This, of course, comes in vivid contrast with a tendency that sometimes wants engineers
to develop new technologies and AR prototypes without having in mind the solution of a
particular problem and trying only a posteriori to discover interesting showcases for a particular
“invention” (Dunser et al., 2007).
As to the application of general HCI guidelines, there are still many major gaps in the domain and
very few contributions. Dunser et al (Dunser et al., 2007) distinguish the following general
guidelines as applicable in the AR context:
1.

Affordance: Affordance is a term coined by Donald Norman in his book “The Design

of Everyday Things” and since then very widely employed (Norman, 1990). It refers to the
connection between an interface and its physical and functional characteristics.
2.

Reducing Cognitive Overhead: This characteristic is closely linked with the previous

as, if a system provides affordance, the cognitive overhead needed to interact with the application
will be low.
3.

Low physical effort: The user should be able to accomplish a task with a minimum of

interaction steps.
4.

Learnability: The user should be able to learn how to use the system easily. For this

reason consistency is of great importance.
5.

User Satisfaction: As the usability of a system does not only rely on objective

measurements, it is important to monitor users’ satisfaction by using a system.
6.

Flexibility of Use: AR designers should be aware of different user preferences and

abilities. In the context of mobile museum guides a more appropriate name for this guideline is
customization/personalization.
7.

Responsiveness/Feedback and Error Tolerance: Users can only take a certain amount

of uncertainty as to the condition of a running application. As one of the major problems that AR
faces is pose estimation and tracking, experiences should be designed so that poor tracking
performance does not interfere with the experience. In the case of the museum particularly, the
performance of an application might be influenced by poor lightening conditions or reflections on
glossy objects or reflective, transparent, showcases.
The authors conclude by recognizing that this is an “initial attempt to fill the gap that exists in the
area” and that there is “too little knowledge about AR systems design to generate generic rules”.
They also insist that multidisciplinary research is welcome as it might allow the combination of
different viewpoints from different areas of expertise, not necessarily from the engineering or
“hard” sciences circle (Dunser et al., 2008).

172

The article of Gabbard et al. (Gabbard et al., 2002) nicely complements this initial list of general
HCI guidelines susceptible to be applicable in AR applications. In their article regarding usability
engineering and AR, they discuss as common usability problems:
1.

A functionality that is missing

2.

Poor user performance on a critical or common task

3.

Catastrophic User Error

4.

Low user satisfaction

5.

Low user adoption of a new system (users susceptible not to use a system again

because they found difficulties in using it).
Another issue that has been explored is the effect of the use of prototypes for the engineering of
AR applications (Anastassova, 2006, Anastassova et al., 2007a, Anastassova et al., 2007b). The
main advantage seem to be that their concreteness facilitates discussions about the elicitation of
future needs and –eventually- alternative designs, as potential users are usually not aware of the
features/functions they can expect from innovative products and applications. However, several
disadvantages have also been spotted. The 1st one, is that prototypes have limitations as there are
usually differences between the prototype proposed and the final application (Liu and
Khooshabeh, 2003). It has also been argued that prototypes usually project engineers’ point of
view and aspirations and inhibit this way other stakeholder’s imagination (Anastassova et al.,
2007b). Finally, low-fidelity prototypes might be stigmatized as less efficient, make users
underperform or even get rejected because of their immaturity (Anastassova, 2006). For all of the
above reasons, Anastassova tried to explore the impact from the use of low-fidelity prototypes in
comparison with high-fidelity prototypes in the case of AR applications. A comparative study she
undertook led her to the conclusions that users express their need more easily and in a more
illustrative way when working with high-fidelity prototypes and that they also seem to be more
motivated. She also underlined the importance of conducting experiments in a real work/domain
setting (Anastassova et al., 2007b). The importance of conducting AR experimentations in real
environments has also been recently discussed by Gabbard and Swan (Gabbard and Swan, 2008).
Finally some very interesting design guidelines, particularly concerning the use of AR for art were
provided by Grasset et al. (Grasset et al., 2007c). Focusing on the use of AR in art settings and the
collaboration of engineers with artists they described in a very accurate way the process that needs
to take place before engineers, artists or museum curators can really discuss about common
projects. With their own words, the design process is “partly dependant on the technical understanding of
the artist, which ranges from identifying a technology, appreciating the role of technology, understand how the

173

technology works, ability to apply that technological concept in design phase, ability to develop/create content and
other work around the technology, ability to use that technology to develop/create what has been designed, through to
being able to create new technology themselves.” Of course a similar process has to occur from the side of
the interaction designers and engineers collaborating in this rich in cultural connotations projects.
For the same reasons, they advice engineers and interaction designers to demonstrate early enough
to other stakeholders (artists, museum curators etc) the limitations of the technology to be
employed, be attentive to the latter’s needs and try to set prioritized design concerns applicable to
the common project. Finally, they conclude, that given the risks and hazards of working with new
technologies, particular consideration should always be paid on whether the chosen technology is
indeed the most suitable for the project.
From this short overview we can understand that evaluation is a very recent research concerning
AR. It is therefore understandable that other important factors such as the affective experience
while using AR systems have yet to be explored (Bickmore and Picard, 2000, Dierking, 2005,
Zhang and Li, 2005). This is only one of the issues we will try to examine during the
experimentations in the museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, despite the limited scale of the evaluation
session. And even though researchers in the AR community are still obliged for the time being to
often follow an “error–fix” explorative approach, as the field evolves, contributions will start to
form informal design guidelines that will then more widely be adopted by the scientific
community(Gabbard and Swan, 2008). In this context, the permission to experiment with real
visitors, in the context of a real museum, trying out an AR enabled multimedia museum guide,
presents inherent interest not only for the final results obtained (presented in Chapter 6), but also
for the suitability of the methodology followed, the protocol retained and the overall planning of
the evaluation session in a real working environment.

5.3.4 PROJECT SPECIFIC METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

The identification and classification of the above mentioned issues was of great help during the
planning of the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes experimentations. However, the particularities of
our case study, shaped at a great part the methodology proposed, and then employed. The goal of
this section is to identify all these factors and explain the way they influenced the experimentation
process.
The first important element is that our experiment was based on the initial hypothesis that a
mobile museum guide using AR technologies and consequently the AR metaphor could facilitate
museum visitors with orientation, navigation and interaction in the museum space and the

174

multimedia application (Damala, 2008). However mobile museum guides are still far from being
the norm among museum proposed interpretation media. In the city of Rennes, none of the
museums or historical sites offers such a possibility. Our collaborating museum also had no prior
knowledge relative with the use of such devices in an exhibition space. It was therefore normal to
assume that the sample that would be recruited would also have no experience on such guides.
Therefore, formulating a research question seeking to answer in an absolute manner whether the
integration of AR in a mobile museum guide confirms the initial hypothesis, as in comparison with
“traditional” mobile museum guides was ruled out. In addition, even if we admitted that such a
prior experience existed, the AR aspect of the guide would not have an autonomous existence,
from the moment it was integrated in a mobile multimedia guide implemented to be used in the
museum space. For museum professionals, AR or not AR enabled, the introduction of mobile
guides in the museum was an issue that needed an impact investigation per se, treating important
aspects, such as attentional balance and user distraction. Therefore, professional deontology
implied a holistic approach in the evaluation that would not only seek to examine the impact from
the introduction of the AR metaphor and the related technologies, but also the way the guide was
actually used in the museum.
A second very serious problem as to the methodology to be employed was related with the
technology embarked in the guide for the experimentation. The term itself, is not widely spread
among occasional IT users, and it was only logic to expect that despite the profiling of the target
group, the majority of the recruited participants would not be familiar with the term AR. This was
also found to be true with our museum partners. Therefore specific attention should be given to
the evaluation protocol and the formulation of the research questions that would be addressed to
the selected sample.
Finally, a third difficulty came from the fact that the Museum had never before conducted a
formative evaluation process, so despite the museum stakeholders’ will to actively participate in
formulating the research questions, the research methodology and the evaluation protocol, it was
not possible to draw on methods or results from former experimentations that might facilitate the
overall appraisal of the role of the guide in the permanent exhibition. For this reason all evaluation
phases, from defining the research questions, to proposing a methodology, laying down the
evaluation protocol and analyzing the results was entirely confided to the author.

175

5.3.5 THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS

The first important step to take was to define the research questions that would be explored
throughout the evaluation phase. As we already saw above, the cross-disciplinary and collaborative
character of the project and the strong implication of the museum professionals in the
experimentations implied an overall assessment of the proposed interpretation medium, larger
than the mere mobile AR character of the multimedia museum guide. However, it was also clear
that because of the restrictions in time and the experimental character of the first prototype, not
all possible evaluation issues could be investigated. Therefore, a “compromise” should be
achieved, ensuring that all project stakeholders would get answers in the most prominent for them
questions.
In order to achieve this, the taxonomy proposed in Table 5.4 was used. Using the table, it soon
became obvious that the issues to be investigated were instances of the 2nd column, the
“Interactive Content” category. Further on, admitting that the use of AR technologies for the
design and implementation of the guide was a concrete issue, a link was established between all
evaluation issues and the probability to shed light on the AR aspect of the proposed guide. A new
table was dressed, in which each topic was correlated with the AR character of the guide and
appointed an adjective, “strong”, “medium” or “weak”, as to the last (Table 5.3).
Consequently two main group of evaluation issues emerged: AR-related evaluation issues and nonAR related issues.
The first group, of primary importance for the acceptance of the AR guide, included the following
research questions:
Does AR facilitate the orientation and navigation in the museum space and the
identification of the commented museum objects?
Does the AR metaphor facilitate the navigation in the interactive content of the guide?
Is the way the AR metaphor is used intuitive and easy to understand even by non
experienced IT users?
Is it possible to investigate further affective reactions related with AR?
Can new means of interaction with mobile AR applications be identified?
Are there any conclusions we can draw both from the evaluation process and the data
analysis that could be of interest for the AR community and other contexts of use?

This group of questions was of great importance for the IT stakeholders but was also judged
interesting enough by the museum professionals.
The second group of questions, less relevant with the AR character of the application but of great
interest for the museum professional, was related with the overall impact of using the guide as well
as with general utility and usability aspects. The most important questions of this group were:
The usefulness and the enjoyability of the application and the general visitor satisfaction
The impact on the post-visit phase and exploring proofs of learning or cognitive impact
The issue of visitor distraction and attentional balance
And finally, preference over specific media

177

5.3.6 THE EVALUATION PROTOCOL RETAINED
The existing bibliography on mobile museum guides provided useful material regarding evaluation
methodologies and issues. However the bibliography did not provide any information on mobile
museum guides actively using AR for geolocalization, navigation and orientation while the relevant
literature among the mobile AR community was also very limited.
At the same time the available technical means (only one device for the experimentations and the
use of an executable under development), and the current state of the art in evaluation regarding
AR applications (as exposed in sections 5.3.1 to 5.3.4) dictated an evaluation approach qualitative
in nature.
However and despite the fact that other researchers have claimed that “formal approaches such as
controlled experiments, structured interviews, and questionnaire surveys presuppose that the
questions of interest are already known” (Woodruff et al., 2001), it was though wiser to try to
formalise not only the main research questions but also part of the evaluation process. A good
argument for adopting this approach was that our sample -comprised of 12 participants- was well
stratified as the museum decision was to target young people, between 18 to 23 years old.
Hence, the protocol proposed included mainly qualitative methods, in accordance with the
exploratory nature of the study, but also made use of a survey. The participants that would be
recruited would be observed by the author. Their sessions would be recorded by an external video
camera, and an ARCHOS multimedia player that would record only the interaction with the
device. A semi-structured interview would then follow (Appendix V). During the interview,
participants would be asked if they are also willing to participate in a focus group session, to be
conducted approximately one and a half month after the visit (Appendix VIIIb). If they
consented, they would also have to fill in a survey (Appendix VI) prior to the focus group session.
Unfortunately, because of the very demanding in terms of resources executable and a certain lack
of time, it was decided not to include a log system in order to log all visitors’ actions. This
inconvenience was partly remediated by the fact that all interactions of the users with the
prototype would be captured by the ARCHOS multimedia player by means of a small camera that
would be attached to the head of the participants using a headband (Figure 5.3b).
The evaluation protocol as well as the questions to be included in the questionnaire was discussed
with all stakeholders prior to release. This intensive, mixed-method evaluation process, combining
three qualitative and one quantitative method, also implied that the number of the participants to

178

be observed should be small, as all phases of the evaluation and analysis of the results would be
carried out only by the author.
Before the experimentation phase began, two pilot evaluation sessions were held in which one
museum educator and one PhD second-year student from the Orange Labs participated. These
pilot sessions proved to be very helpful regarding the overall planning of the evaluation but also
regarding some last minute “arrangements”, like the idea to try to compensate the lack of a
dedicated platform by using black adhesive tape to mask and mark the buttons that were to avoid
touching, and colourful adhesive pastilles to indicate the two buttons that served in manipulating
the application.

5.4 TASK AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

5.4.1 INTRODUCTION

This section introduces notions relevant with the experimentation environment, the experimental
variables and the experimentation process. The description of the experimental conditions and the
setup follows a chronological order with respect to the evaluation protocol proposed for the
experimentations.

5.4.2 RECRUITING THE CANDIDATES

As mentioned earlier, it was decided to recruit 12 participants for the experimentations, equally
representing both sexes. The Museum of Fine Arts volunteered to act as an intermediate for the
recruitment of the participants and contacted two University professors, asking them to pass on
the message to their students. The contacted University departments for the recruitment of the
participants were The School of Fine Arts in Rennes (Ecole des Beaux Arts de Rennes) and the
University Institute of Technology in Social Sciences (Institut Universitaire de Technologie I.U.T.). The common characteristic among all students was the age, while –hypothetically- the
profile difference lied in the fact that the 1st group of students was susceptible to visit museums
and galleries more often because of the related field of studies, thus augmenting the chances of
possible comparisons in between frequent and occasional museum visitors.
A remuneration or “thank you” gift was foreseen, comprised of a gift voucher provided by
Orange Labs and a book of the choice of the participants to be selected in the museum shop. In
addition, participants also received a photo of them during the experimentations, as a souvenir of
their experience. However, it is important to notice that at the time of the announcement of the

179

experimentations, this element was intentionally not mentioned so as to ensure that the motivation
for participating in the experimentations would not ne linked with the remuneration. Finally,
before the beginning of the experimentations all participants were contacted by phone. The scope
and the goals of the study were briefly presented to them while a detailed, written presentation of
the study and the experimentation protocol was sent at their e-mail addresses. The consent form
was also sent by mail for information though printed copies were also provided on site, before the
end of each session (see APPENDIX VIc).
The decision of contacting University departments, narrowed further down the age of participants
from 18-30, to 18-23. However, despite the efforts for including equal male and female
representatives from each University Department, the sample consisted of 4 male and 2 female
representatives of the School of Fine Arts, and 2 male and 4 female participants from the
University Institute of Technology in Social Sciences (IUT), so as to balance the distribution of
male and female participants.

5.4.3 WELCOMING THE PARTICIPANTS

Before the beginning of each experimental session, participants were welcomed and introduced to
the research team (the author-observer and the second researcher or assistant that dealt with the
modalities of recording the full session using a digital video camera and a tripod). After the
welcome, some first instructions were given to the candidates regarding the two devices, the
UMPC and the ARCHOS multimedia recorder. Then the ARCHOS equipment was adjusted on
each participant. A small tutorial, provided by the UMPC, was also proposed to the participants
for getting acquainted with the use of the buttons of the device. Finally, before participants started
their augmented visit, they were assured that it was the guide and not themselves being put on the
benchmark.

5.4.4 DIRECT AND INDIRECT OBSERVATION

The observation of the participants was not only a choice but also a necessity. As mentioned in
section 4.2.2, the device used was a generic UMPC. Despite the fact that adhesive black tape was
used to indicate which buttons were not to be touched, it happened that an unintentional move
perturbed the execution of the application, necessitating a direct intervention by the research team
in order to bring the application back to its previous state. But even under ideal circumstances, the
battery of the UMPC had to be replaced, approximately after 60 minutes of use. For these reasons,
“participatory”, direct, observation was considered necessary in addition to indirect observation
that would occur later by visioning the video recordings. Another advantage of the direct

180

observation approach was that it encouraged communication and discussion with the candidates.
Figure 5.2a and 5.2b shows the positioning of the research team and the participants during the
observation.
In addition to this “real-time” observation, the interaction of the participant with the guide, the
paintings and the environment -including the observer- was recorded by a digital video camera set
on a tripod and manipulated by another member of the research team. The participation of a 2nd
person was essential as apart from changing the storage medium of the digital camcorder, frequent
moving of all the equipment was also necessary because the commented paintings were dispersed
in three different museum galleries.

Figure 5.2a-5.2b: A. Positioning of the main actors during the observation, B. Experimental conditions, plan of one of the
museum galleries

Finally, as the use of logs was not retained for technical reasons, all details of the interaction of the
students with the guide were captured and recorded using an ARCHOS multimedia player,
equipped with a head camera worn by the students. The multimedia player itself was placed in a
waist-bag, also worn by the students (Figure 5.3a). The observation started directly after the
participant had been told to try to locate the commented paintings and then navigate in the
application content.
Despite our fears, that shadowing might perturb or intimidate participants, no particular problems
were observed and students seemed to feel at ease with the researcher’s presence. The double
recordings of the interaction of the participant with the device itself as well as with the
surrounding environment were daily archived, for further analysis.

181

5.4.5 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS

In each evaluation session, a minimum of 15 minutes was reserved for conducting a short, postvisit, semi-structured interview. The interview usually took place in the museum amphitheatre and
was recorded using the same ARCHOS multimedia recorder that had been used for the recording
of the participants’ session.

Figure 5.3a-5.3b: A. a student wearing the waist-bag containing the ARCHOS player B. a student wearing the
web camera for the recording on the on-screen action
Interviews were essential in order to capture the first impressions from using the guide, while still
alive, but were also very helpful in identifying key issues related with the user experience. The
warm-up questions were related with personal information regarding the participants as well as
relations with museum visiting, while the 2nd part of the interview was mainly focused on
impressions from using the guide. Whenever it was possible, some discussion more closely related
with the notions of Augmented and Virtual Reality followed, as a preparation for the focus group
session that would follow some weeks later. However, as this phase of the experimentation was
mainly dedicated to the general look and feel of the application, rare were the times that such
occasions aroused.
In practice, however, two interviews had to take place in a more informal environment, especially
during the morning sessions, as the slightest delay on the 1st morning session automatically
implied that there were chances that the museum closes its doors for midday before the 2nd
session reaches its end. The less formal environments that hosted these interviews were not
appropriate for obtaining usable audio records for later consultation. Writing down notes in these
cases proved essential.
An important remark regarding the interviews taken was that very soon, the diversity of positions
and opinions expressed, confirmed the initial hypothesis that despite the small sample used for the

182

experimentations, a survey would be useful both for formalizing the results as well as for
preparing the ground for the next evaluation sessions.

5.4.6 THE SURVEY

5.4.6.1 Introduction
Conducting the interviews provided an interesting input as to the topics that should be introduced
in the survey as well as for the level of detail of each evaluation key-point examined. The survey
therefore, would complement the -exploratory in nature- observations and interviews, allowing as
well a formalization of the results as, contrary to the interviews, all participants would have to
answer the same set of questions, at the same order.
However, the survey served another very important issue: shedding light -for the first time since
the beginning of the experimentations- on the user experience regarding Augmented Reality as a
mean for orientation, navigation and interaction with a mobile museum guide. As the selected
sample had no prior experience either with mobile museum guides or with the notion of
Augmented Reality, special attention had to be given in the formulation of statements regarding
the AR aspect of the mobile guide. Because of the highly contextual character of the experimental
intervention, the survey included also questions relative with the overall user experience and
satisfaction using a mobile multimedia guide in the museum environment, an issue of great
importance for the museum stakeholders. As with all other phases of the experimentation, the
creation of the survey benefited by the collaborative character of the project, with all involved
stakeholders invited to provide input or feedback concerning the survey questions.

5.4.6.2 Content and structure of the survey
The survey was divided in 5 parts and a welcome note or a total of 46 questions (APPENDIX VI)
and took in between 7 and 10 minutes to be completed. The 1st section consisted of general
questions that helped in formalizing and shaping participants’ profiles, especially regarding
museum visiting habits and the use of IT.
The 2nd section was entitled “Questions regarding the use of the guide” and included questions
related with the usability of the guide, particularly in concern with the use of Augmented Reality
for orientation, navigation and interaction in the museum context. The questions were formulated
in such a way so that no particular prior knowledge of terminology was necessitated.

183

The 3rd section was constituted of questions examining the content effectiveness. By “content
effectiveness” we mean here both the content in terms of included interpretation material as well
as characteristics relative with the effectiveness of the content presentation. This ambiguity was
intentional, as we did not want to confuse the participants with questions including terms like
“interface”.
The 4th section set the goal to explore a sensitive topic, common to the AR-based conception of
the guide as well as to the principle of using a mobile multimedia guide in the museum context:
the interplays between the visitor, the multimedia guide and the commented painting. The
“attentional balance” issue, defined by Woodruff et al. (Woodruff et al., 2002), as the continuous
swift of attention of a museum visitor between the environment, the interactive device and other
co-visitors had raised the concern of the museum professionals, especially regarding the effects
from introducing mobile multimedia guides in the sensitive museum ecology (see also section 2.5).
Finally, the 5th section mainly contained questions regarding the post-visit effect. Though there
was no intention of a formalization of the evaluation as to the cognitive impact of the visit, it was
judged essential to include a minimum of questions regarding this issue.
Given that the survey had to be as comprehensive as possible, sometimes more than one way was
used in formulating “tricky” questions, subsequently placed either under the same section or under
another one. The full content of the survey is presented in Appendix VI while the results are
presented in detail in the next chapter.

5.4.6.3 “Measuring” the effectiveness of the AR guide
Most of the survey questions were “closed”, though open-ended questions, encouraging
participants to freely express themselves were also employed in some occasions. On certain
occasions, statements seemed more convenient to be employed; participants, in this case, were
expected to express their level of agreement.
A Likert-like, 4-point scale was preferred over a 5-point, as the 5-point scale, which includes a
neutrality statement, may create confusion between the statements “I am neutral”, or “I don’t
have an opinion” (Albaum, 1997). Therefore, our scale consisted of the “Mostly Agree” statement,
followed by the “Somewhat Agree”, “Somewhat Disagree” and “Mostly Disagree” statements that
during the analysis were attributed a 1 to 4 score. Attention was given in alternating the positively
and negatively worded statements, in order to control the “acquiescence” effect, resulting in
participants repeatedly giving the same answer (Kuniavsky, 2003, Love, 2005). The 1 to 4 score is

184

reversed in case the preceding statement is negative. An additional advantage of employing a
Likert scale is that percentages can be combined with the calculation of usability scores on a 1 to 4
scale, not only for the research questions but also for each participant individually.

5.4.6.4 Survey creation, release and collection.
“Survey Monkey” was used as a tool for the creation and release of the survey as well as for
collecting the responses. The basic, free subscription gives a possibility of 100 responses per
survey. Participants were invited by mail to fill in the survey that was posted on the web, though a
printable version of the questionnaire was also sent by mail. Printed copies of the survey were also
available during the focus group sessions.

5.4.6.5 Some post-collection remarks
Despite the fact that all survey questions were scrutinized by all stakeholders, certain
misunderstandings proved difficult to be avoided. For example in one of the questions
participants were asked if they remembered the name of one or more painters whose work had
been included in the guide. The way the phrase was constructed in French could be interpreted
both as “Can you recall any of the names of the artists whose work was presented?”, as well as
“Do you recall one or more names of artists whose work was presented?”. As a result, not all
students interpreted the question in the same way.

5.4.7 THE FOCUS GROUPS

Finding an appropriate date for conducting the two focus groups, proved to be the more daunting
task related with this part of the experimentations. Eventually, it became possible to gather all 12
participants in 2 groups of six persons, approximately six weeks after the beginning of the
experimentation process with a difference of 1 day, but in two different environments: The 1st
focus group took place in the museum during midday with the presence of our corresponding
museum curator, while the 2nd focus group was conducted in Orange Labs, situated near the 2nd
University department participating in the study. Both focus group sessions were filmed using two
cameras in order to avoid loss of data due to the insufficient capacity of the available video
cameras storage medium (Figure 5.4a). In addition, the audio was captured separately using a
professional flash audio recorder.
As the available time in each case was limited to a maximum of approximately an hour and a half,
the sessions had to be carefully moderated. Five main topics were introduced:

185

1.
Interpretation media in the museum setting and resemblances/differences with the
mobile multimedia guide.
2.
The interplays between the mobile guide and the object as perceived by the
participants
3.
Augmented Reality as a mean for orientation, navigation and interaction
4.
Other possible applications or scenarios based on Augmented Reality
5.
Feedback relevant with the prototype tested
Finally, shortly before the end of each session, “sticky notes” notes were distributed to all
participants, who were asked to attribute some “must-have” or “must-have-not” characteristics to
the mobile multimedia guide from which a collage was created.

5.5 DISCUSSION

This chapter exposed in detail the numerous factors that affected the creation of the evaluation
protocol for the AR enabled mobile guide designed and implemented for the Museum of Fine
Arts in Rennes. The first step taken towards this direction was the presentation of current trends
and practices in the domain of evaluation of mobile museum guides. The most important remark
regarding this issue was that though evaluation initiatives have been accredited sufficient
importance, no effort had been made regarding the systematization of relevant evaluation keypoints and research questions. In order to fill this gap, a new taxonomy and classification scheme
was proposed by the author. Three types of evaluation key points were identified, related with the
technological choices, the interactive content as well as with administration issues, while it was

186

argued that all three types can be evaluated with all of the involved stakeholders, namely IT
companies, museum professionals, museum visitors and eventually potential sponsors.
However, the particularity of the undertaken evaluation does not just lie in the fact that the type of
application examined is still rather innovative; it also inherits particularities because of the
featured, still emerging, mobile AR technology. Subsequently, in addition to the state of the art
regarding evaluation practices for mobile museum guides, an investigation of evaluation practices
for mobile AR applications was also judged essential. The literature review pointed out that AR
has not been characterized “technology-centric” without reason, as it does not boast specific
design guidelines and has no standardized delivery platforms and interaction components; at the
same time it seems that there is a lack of knowledge not only on how to conduct evaluation but
also on understanding that evaluation activities are of paramount importance. Within this quite
troubling framework, current practices in the domain of AR applications’ evaluation were
presented as well as some progressively emerging design guidelines, which also helped in
highlighting common usability problems susceptible to appear in AR applications.
In order to complete the picture, project-specific methodological considerations, like for example
the fact of working with stakeholders and subjects with no prior knowledge regarding mobile AR
applications, were also presented. At the same time, the particularities of the environment for
which the application was deployed, implied the making-up of an evaluation protocol that had to
take under consideration both AR and non-AR related research questions.
Finally, after taking under consideration all of the above mentioned parameters, the mixed-method
evaluation protocol, composed by observations, semi-structured interviews, the use of a survey
and two focus groups, were presented in detail, together with the experimental set-up. In the next
chapter we will take a closer look at the results that the evaluation yielded but also in the ways the
gathered data was analyzed.

CHAPTER 6
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

6.1 INTRODUCTION

In the previous chapter we examined the evaluation protocol and its shaping through a thorough
literature review regarding both the evaluation of mobile multimedia museum guides and mobile
AR applications. In this chapter the methodology for data analysis will be exposed, before delving
into the results of each one of the evaluation phases. Regarding the presentation of the results, it is
important to notice that apart from the main research questions exposed in section 5.3.5, other
issues that had not been foreseen were also detected. For this reason, each evaluation session is
presented separately, while the structure of each individual evaluation session is conformant not
necessarily with the specific, predefined, research questions but with the classification of the main
issues that emerged in practice, through all phases of the experimentations. In the last section, a
regrouping of the most important findings of all evaluation sessions is provided.

6.2 SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS OBSERVATION

6.2.1 INTRODUCTION

In the time span of approximately two weeks 12 visitors were observed. Despite the fact that all
sessions were recorded both by the video camera as well as by the ARCHOS recorder, all
participants were also observed throughout the full visit by one of the researchers as explained in
section 5.4.4 (Figures 5.2a-5.2b). Extensive notes were taken, while the records of the visit, both
from the digital camcorder and the ARCHOS multimedia player were viewed, analyzed and coded
after the end of the experimentations. No particular software was used for this video analysis;
instead all incidents that occurred were noted, tagged and categorized. Two main categories of
findings resulted from this analysis: observations on participants’ interaction with the mobile AR
189

guide and the museum environment and incidents with a potential influence on the overall user
experience. More in particular, the findings can be distinguished in five different categories:
a)

Observations on participants’ interaction with the museum environment and the AR guide

b)

Incidents related with the experimentation environment

c)

Incidents caused by the observer

d)

Incidents caused by the hardware

e)

Incidents provoked by the interface

6.2.2 OBSERVATIONS ON PARTICIPANTS INTERACTION WITH THE MUSEUM AND THE AR
GUIDE

As already exposed in section 3.1, the issue of interaction with the mobile museum AR application
is far more complex than the issue of interaction with fixed or mobile interactive multimedia
applications. The main reason for that is that the user needs to be primarily considered as a
museum visitor whose primary goal is not just to interact with a mobile interactive application but
rather with other co-visitors, the museum environment and selected museum objects. This section
aims to shed some light on the observed on-site interactions with the mobile AR application, the
commented museum objects and the surrounding museum environment. As the visitors’ attention
switches from the guide, to the environment and vice versa, these actions (interacting with the
guide, interacting with the museum environment, interacting with museum objects) have to be
correlated and examined the one in conjunction with the other.
After adjusting all the material needed for the experimentations, participants were asked to follow
a short tutorial regarding the manipulation of the application and the function of the application
controls. Then, the first task visitors were asked to perform was to locate the works for which
further resources were available. Once the painting was located, the visitors were asked to freely
navigate in the content according to their preferences and preferably exactly as they would do if
they were visiting alone. However, in spite of how well the tutorial prepared each participant, the
best introduction turned out to be using the guide for real. All participants demonstrated a much
better understanding of the application, after having completed the visit of the first painting.
Stressed and less confident participants were more error prone at the beginning of the visit. A
common incident was that some users needed time to understand that the entire painting had to
be captured in order for the virtual overlays to appear. The audio prompt produced when a
painting was detected proved also useful, as it provided direct feedback to the users, whose
190

attention was distributed in between the surrounding museum environment and the AR guide
application.
One of the key points of the evaluation was whether the detection of the four commented
paintings, using the AR metaphor, was easy to accomplish as a task. Observing the visitors in this
case provided considerable input as to the identification of the commented works. Participants in
their majority showed ability to identify the paintings in a time span of 1 to 7 seconds. This is quite
impressive, as all three museum galleries in which the experimentations took place contained an
average of at least 20 paintings. This remark becomes even more determining as it also holds true
for the 4th painting, usually lastly visited, the “Bather” of Picasso, despite the fact that the
inadequate lightening conditions and the small size of the painting, made it one of the most
difficult to be detected by the system. Only two participants met some difficulties in identifying
the first paintings, but once the identification mechanism – “scanning” the whole painting- was
grasped, they achieved to successfully identify the other three paintings in the same time span as
the other 10 participants. Another proof for the easiness of executing this first task is that during
the semi-structured interviews it was mainly the author that had to bring up the topic of whether
the identification of the paintings was easy or not.
The overall duration of the visits ranged between 25 and 50 minutes according to visitors
particular interests. Apart the random and selective activation of each painting’s themes, two other
schemes of navigation were identified. In the first scheme, visitors followed the proposed order in
consulting the content. Other visitors preferred activating the themes in a different but consistent
order throughout the full visit (for example, choosing always first the “artist”, then the
“description”, then the “iconography”, etc.). Despite the fact that participants were advised to
investigate only the themes they were interested in, the majority chose to watch most or all of the
available multimedia sequences.
One of the design choices of the application, as described in section 4.8, was the inclusion of a
touch-sensitive “Pause” button, displayed on the main window of the application. The “Pause”
button provided visitors with the possibility to “freeze” the captured video, so that the virtual
overlays stay stable around the commented, video-captured, painting. In English the word to be
employed would be “freeze”; in French however, the word “geler” was not found appropriate.
This feature provoked several misunderstandings. The 1st one was that as -unlike all other
buttons- the freeze button was touch-sensitive, some participants believed, by generalisation, that
other virtual overlays were also touch-sensitive. The 2nd one was that many participants tried to
use the button for pausing the content of the audio or the multimedia presentations and not for
191

freezing the video, thus revealing a missing functionality of a pause button, also identified during
the interviews session. Though the change was relatively easy to implement, it was decided to
continue the experimentations maintaining the same configuration for all participants.
Another attitude observed was that the majority of participants that happened to visit first the
only painting for which the audio and the text provided was the same, made the reasonable
assumption that this holds true whenever an audio is present together with a text. A pleasant
surprise was that participants were very careful to what they looked and heard. This became
apparent in one of the multimedia sequences for which the audio provided was not completely
synchronized with the accompanying image.

Figure 6.1a-6.1d: Visitor attitudes using the mobile guide during the visit.
One of the arguments that have been heard and discussed a lot is that multimedia guides in the
museum setting tend to monopolize the attention of the visitors. Therefore, synchronous and
asynchronous observation gave interesting feedback related to this matter. Attitudes varied from
visitor to visitor, but many participants took pauses in between the multimedia sequences to better
contemplate the paintings (Figure 6.1a), did not look the guide when activating an audio
commentary, went back and forth, in order to examine the painting closer (Figure 6.1b, 6.1c),
while some of them even felt the need to consult the small text etiquettes placed on the wall
192

(Figure 6.1d), despite the fact that the same information was provided to them by the title bar of
each presentation.
Figure 6.2a-6.2d, captures the change of focus and attention, of a female participant, in the time
span of 20 seconds. In Figure 6.2a, the participant is reading a text on the UMPC (1:00-1:14”). In
Figure 6.2b she is switching from the UMPC to the painting (6.2c) which she fixes for 6 seconds
(1:14-1:20”). Finally, in Figure 6.2d (1:21”) she comes back to the guide’s content.

Figure 6.2a-6.2b: Visitor change of focus of attention, as recorded by the ARCHOS multimedia recorder
A major usability issue was related with the delivery of the audio. As participants were carrying
different pieces of equipment, it was decided not to add headphones for the audio delivery but
rather use the integrated UMPC speakers. When the museum galleries were calm, no particular
problems with the audio were observed. But this was not always the case, as several times, groups
-mainly composed of young children- were present in the museum, rendering the listening of the
audio comments difficult at times. Some of the students that met this problem tried to
compensate it by placing the guide closer to their ears, in order to listen better (Figure 6.3a-6.3b).
Since the problem was observed only after the beginning of the experimentations, the decision
taken was to continue with the same configuration and not to provide headphones, in order to
keep the same experimentation parameters.

193

6.2.3 INCIDENTS RELATED WITH THE EXPERIMENTATION ENVIRONMENT

As all visits took place in a real world environment, during regular museum opening hours, it was
normal that occasionally the museum galleries became noisy and busy, mainly because of school
group visits. Whenever there was an accompanying museum educator arrangements were made so
as to “share” the museum galleries.
Another significant remark regarding the experimentation environment was the interest that was
manifested by other present visitors. This curiosity was especially vivid in case of young visitors
and children (Figure 6.4). Other museum staff, for example the museum guards, also manifested a
strong interest in the experimentations.

Figure 6.4: Young visitors manifesting their curiosity for the multimedia guide
6.2.4 INCIDENTS CAUSED BY THE OBSERVER

As already noticed, in section 5.4.4, the observation conducted was direct and participative. This
way, participants could, if they chose to, communicate with the observer. Help was sometimes
demanded at the beginning of some sessions. Other occasions in which the writer-observer had to
intervene were provoked by system crashes or in case of a necessitated battery change.
In spite of the tight “shadowing” throughout the full duration of the visits, participants seemed to
feel at ease with the observer and the rest of the team, even in cases where other project members
were present. As to whether the occasional presence of other museum visitors perturbed the
participants, no particular sign of discomfort was demonstrated.

194

Thought the students had not been explicitly advised to use the “think aloud” protocol, several
participants opted for this approach, thus sharing valuable thoughts with the observer during their
guided visit.
Finally, intervention was necessary in case participants had to accelerate their visit, particularly if
two visits had been scheduled for the morning session. This type of intervention was sometimes
accompanied by a certain frustration. For example, one female participant asked whether it could
be possible to come back at another time so as to retake the tour.

6.2.5 INCIDENTS CAUSED BY THE DEVICE (HARDWARE)

Another category of incidents observed, was clearly related with the hardware configuration used
for the experimentations. Unfortunately the lack of a dedicated platform necessitated the use of
commercial, already configured, equipment. In our case, as already detailed in section 4.2.2, we
used a Samsung Q1 Origami UMPC together with an ordinary web cam (Chapter 4, Figure 4.1).
Out of the four buttons present on the front surface of the device, only two were used as controls
of the AR application. However, the two other buttons on the left side of the apparatus were
impossible to disable. For this reason, they were covered with black adhesive tape, while
participants were told that they should avoid touching them. Despite these precautions, several
system crashes were provoked, because the application terminated abruptly by an accidental
activation of one of the “camouflaged” buttons.
Because of the decision to record all sessions with the ARCHOS multimedia player using the
accompanying head camera, it was absolutely necessary that participants hold the guide at the
height of their shoulders (Figure 6.5), so that the interaction with the application can be recorded.
Objectively, this was a very tiring position for the participants. Some of them needed to be
reminded to hold “correctly” the device so as to obtain effective recordings, while some others
were applying on letter the rule and needed to be reminded to take a rest. As a consequence not all
ARCHOS recordings were of the same quality. In these cases, the audio recordings of the
ARCHOS, made possible by the microphone attached to the head camera, proved to be very
useful.

6.2.6 LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH OBSERVATION

The observations provided useful input as to the usability of the AR museum guide prototype but
also as to the user experience. Starting from the very specific and then examining the more general
or context-related elements of the experimentation, problems related with the interface will be
195

firstly resumed, followed by context specific observations, like the choice of the device used or the
experimental conditions.

6.2.6.1 The interface
Consistency proves to be an important element linking most incidents or misunderstandings
resulting by the interface design. More in particular, the pattern of identification of the
commented works, based on the AR principle, seemed to be understood by all participants
quickly, especially after having achieved the detection of the 1st painting.
On the contrary, the lack of consistency provoked several incidents. For example, the fact that one
of the paintings revealed the same information in both text and audio, made participants believe
that the audio and text content found at the same level, reveal the same information.
The same holds true for the “pause” button. By generalization, some participants believed that the
other overlays were also touch-sensitive, despite the fact that they had been instructed which
buttons to use for the manipulation of the application. The name chosen for the “pause” button
also provoked a misunderstanding but also revealed a missing functionality, the lack of controls
for pausing, rewinding and forwarding audio comments and some of the multimedia
presentations.

Equally related with the presentation of the content of the application, an intentionally included
non synchronization of sound and image was observed by most participants, implying that even in
terms of multimedia narration, consistency is an important and necessary element.

6.2.6.2 The equipment
The lack of dedicated hardware provoked, as expected, several incidents during the
experimentation, as for example system breakdowns because of an unintentional activation of one
of the non application-related device buttons or visit disruptions so as to proceed with a battery
change. In addition, the recording of all sessions by the ARCHOS multimedia player necessitated
that participants hold the device at the height of their shoulders, in a quite uncomfortable position
(Figure 6.5). This necessary experimentation equipment, dictated the choice of delivering the audio
through the UMPC speakers, a solution that in reality turned out to be problematic especially in
cases where large school groups were also present in the same museum gallery.

6.2.6.3 The environment
The unpredictability of other visitors’ affluence in the same space during the experimentations was
an element that sometimes perturbed the personal choice of the participant as from where to start
the guided visit. Another type of incident occurred during the morning experimentations that had
to end before midday; so in case two visits were scheduled, a delay during the first visit implied
that the second participant might have to be prompted to shorten his visit, so that the interview
takes place. In two such cases, the interviews had to be conducted in noisy environments outside
the museum, resulting in loss of data.

6.2.6.4 Possible improvements
The importance of this part of the experimentation becomes more apparent when compared with
the feedback obtained in other experimentation phases. The most illustrative example concerns
the effects of the inclusion of the touch sensitive “pause” button. While other remarks (e.g. the
repetition of the same content in a text and audio sequence, the difficulty in hearing the audio
when large groups of visitors were present) were reported by the participants in other parts of the
evaluation process, the effects provoked by the “pause” button (using the button to pause the
multimedia content, or touching other areas of the screen thinking that they are also interactive)
were very briefly reported only on one occasion, and by only one participant. As many other
participants also faced this problem, it seems that the problem was not reported because it was not
197

perceived as an application error but rather as a “faulty” behaviour from the part of the
participants. Apart this remark, it seems obvious from the observations made, that the overall user
experience could benefit enormously by an application-specific device, by delivering the audio
through headphones and by attempting to record the on-screen action with a more comfortable regarding participants- device configuration.
6.3 THE SURVEY

6.3.1 PARTICIPANTS’ PROFILES

Students of both University departments were aged between 18 and 23 years old with the average
age being 20.75. An equal representation of male and female participants was achieved. The
participating students own a mobile phone from the age of 15/16, with the exception of two that
have been using one from the age of 12 and 14 years old respectively. Regarding the frequency of
computer use, 8 students (66.67%) answered that they use one very often (everyday), 3 students
(25.00%) regularly (several times per week), and 1 student rarely (several times per month).
However, it was noticed that male students use a computer more frequently than female students
(Charts’ Graph 1).
None of the participants had heard the term Augmented Reality before the beginning of the
experimentations. As to the term “Virtual Reality”, only 2 students were certain of what it means;
3 were not certain and 7 replied that they do not know. Similarly, none of the participants had
used a UMPC or PDA before.

6.3.2 PARTICIPANTS AND MUSEUM VISITING HABITS

All participants had already visited the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes prior to the
experimentations and had the habit of museum visiting. Regarding the frequency, 7 participants
(58.3%) replied visiting museums very often, meaning four times per year or more, 3 (25.00%)
regularly, meaning two to three times per year, and 2 participants (16.67%) rarely, meaning 1 time
a year or so. It is worth noticing that from the 58.3% representing the frequent museum goers, the
50% corresponds to the totality of the Fine Arts students (Charts’ Graph 1).
Despite the fact that it is widely accepted that museum visiting is a social activity (Falk and
Dierking, 1992), 58.3% of the participants answered that they prefer visiting museums alone. The
proportion was larger among the Fine Arts students in comparison with the Social Sciences
students. As to whether, once on site, they usually use interpretation material, the answers were
198

equally divided in between “yes” and “no”. The proportion was the same between male and
female as well as in between the two university departments. As to the nature of the interpretation
material used, museum provided printed material comes first on top with (50%), followed by
books, web sites and on-site multimedia kiosks (16.7%) and audio guides (8.3%). No participant
opted for the “guided visit” option (Charts’ Graph 1). Some reasons for that were revealed during
the semi-structured interviews (section 6.4)

6.3.3 USABILITY OF THE AR GUIDE

This section, composed of five “closed” and two open-ended questions, was one of the most
crucial regarding the main AR aspects of the prototype tested. More particularly, the statements
included in this section intended to examine the overall ease of use of the guide, the easiness of
identification of the commented works and the easiness of navigation in the guide’s content.
Finally a statement regarding the help provided by the small tutorial before the beginning of the
experimentations was also included.

Charts' Graph 2: Usability of the AR guide
The first statement was: “Identifying the commented works was easy” and found 5 out of 12
participants (58.30%) to “Mostly Agree” and 7 (41.70%) to “Somewhat Agree”, thus -using the
Likert-scale- giving a score of 3.4. The following statement, related with the navigation in the
content of the guide was: “Navigating through the content of the guide was easy” and scored 3.25,
with 3 participants (25%) answering that they “Mostly Agree”, and 9 (75%) that they “Somewhat
Agree”. The statement “Using the guide was easy” found 3 participants (25%) to “Mostly Agree”,
6 participants (58.33%) to “Somewhat Agree” and 2 participants (16.67%) to “Somewhat
Disagree” (score= 3.08).
Participants were also asked to position themselves on the statement “The real objects augmented
with the virtual ones facilitated the access in the content”. The answers given were equally
distributed between the “Mostly Agree”, “Somewhat Agree” and “Somewhat Disagree” options,
achieving a score of 2.25. This is a good example of how the way of formulating phrases can
influence the answers obtained during evaluation, given that this statement was included as a
complement of the first two, concerning the easiness of navigation and orientation using the
guide.
In addition to the above questions, this section also included two, complementary, open-ended
questions. 5 out of 12 students (~ 41, 7%) answered the open-ended questions “Is there anything
that you would wish the guide do” and “Is there anything that you would wish the guide not to
do”. The answers are presented in Tables 6.2 and 6.3 and are further discussed at the end of this
section.
Finally, the last statement of this section was: “The tutorial at the beginning of the visit helped me
understand how to use the guide”. 7 students (58.33%) answered that they “Somewhat Agree”, 4
students (33.33%) that they “Mostly Agree” while 1 student (8.33%) chose the “Mostly Disagree”
201

option. The scores obtained for the above statements, by using the 1 to 4 Likert scale, are
presented in Table 6.1.

6.3.4 MEASURING THE CONTENT EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GUIDE

The third part of the survey was constituted of questions examining the content effectiveness (the
notion of “content” was also discussed in section 4.8.1., where the different meanings the word
“content” can acquire were highlighted).
The first statement regarded the intuitive comprehension of the available themes, namely the
“Context”, “Artist”, “Description”, “Analysis” and “Technique” themes. The score obtained was
3.4, with 7 participants (58.33%) choosing the “Mostly Agree” option, 4 participants (33.33%) the
“Somewhat Agree” option and 1 participant (8.33%) the “Somewhat Disagree” option.

202

One of the most interesting questions included in this section was related to the way participants
used the “components” of the multimedia guide. 66.7 % or 8 participants answered that they
listened to the audio, 66.7% or 8 participants that they watched the provided images, 41.7 % or 5
participants that they read the included texts, 33.3 % or 4 participants that they watched the
multimedia presentations and 25% or 3 participants that they watched a video.

Charts' Graph 3: Content effectiveness
During the multimedia presentations, comparative images were sometimes provided, displayed
alongside with the real paintings, so as to create bonds with other, close ichnographically and
stylistically paintings. One of the statements of this section tried to investigate whether these
images helped the participants better approach the selected paintings or interfered with their
appropriation of the selected works. The option “Other” was also proposed as an open-ended
option, providing participants with the possibility to express their own feelings if the provided
options could not accommodate them. 6 participants (50%) answered that they were helped by the
images, 3 (25%) participants that the images rather interfered than helped in the appreciation the
paintings, and 3 participants (25%) chose the option “Other”, specifying that in some cases they
were helped and in some others not.

203

Four questions of this section were related with the multimedia use in the paintings’ presentations.
The sentence “The quality of the multimedia presentations was what I would expect from a
multimedia guide” found 4 participants (33.33%)

to “Mostly Agree”, 6 students (50%) to

“Somewhat Agree” and 2 students (16.67%) to “Somewhat Disagree”. As to the length of the
multimedia presentations, participants were provided with the options “Not long enough”,
“Satisfactory” and “Much Too Long”. 11 out of 12 participants (91.67%) found the length to be
satisfactory while 1 participant stated that the multimedia presentations were not long enough.
Two other sets of questions were related with the quality and the length of the text and the audio
provided in the guide. The statement “The quality of the provided text was what I would expect
from a multimedia guide” found 11 of the 12 participants (91.7%) to “Somewhat Agree”, and 1
participant (8.30%) to “Mostly Agree”. On the subject of the length of the text provided, 1
student (8.33%) found that it was “Much too long”, while 11 students (91.67%) though that the
length was “Satisfactory”, meaning neither too long nor too short while none of the participants
chose the “Not interested in having text in such a guide” option. As to the audio, the statement
“The quality of the audio comments corresponded to what I would expect from a multimedia
guide”, found 3 students (25%) to “Mostly Agree”, 8 (66.7%) to “Somewhat Agree” and 1 (8.33%)
to “Somewhat Disagree”. “The duration of the audio comments was neither too short nor too
long” statement, created a polarity with half of the participants (50%) declaring to “Somewhat
Agree”, and the other half (50%) to “Somewhat Disagree”.

6.3.5 EXPLORING THE INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN THE CULTURAL OBJECT AND THE
GUIDE

This session is one of the most interesting as it demanded from participants to adopt a position as
to the impact the use of the guide had on their visit, a topic that has been much discussed and
raised concerns from many museum professionals (see also section 5.2.1).
The first statement demanded from participants to take a position regarding the statement “I find
that using the guide distracted me from contemplating the real work of art”. The answers were
scattered among all 4 choices: 4 participants (33.3%) answered that they ”Somewhat Agree”, 4
participants (33.33%) that they ”Somewhat Disagree”, 3 participants (25% ) that they ”Mostly
Agree” and 1 participant (8.33%) chose the ”Strongly Disagree” option.
The statement: “I find that using the guide helped me better comprehend and appreciate the
paintings” found 9 participants (75%) to “Strongly Agree”, 2 participants (16.67%) to “Mostly
Agree” and 1 participant (8.33%) to “Somewhat Disagree”. Participants were also asked to take a
position for the statement “I learned more than what I would have learned having not used the
guide”. 9 participants (75%) expressed themselves positively (“Mostly Agree” or “Somewhat
Agree” statements) and 3 participants (25%) negatively (Somewhat or Mostly Disagree). All of the
participants expressed a positive attitude regarding the statement “Using the guide was playful”
with answers equally divided between “Strongly Agree” and “Mostly Agree” options. The last
statement of this section was “The visiting experience was better than the one I’d have having not
used the guide”. 3 participants (25%) stated that they “Mostly Agree”, 5 participants (41.67%)
that they “Somewhat Agree” and 4 participants (33.33%) that they “Somewhat Disagree”. The
scores obtained are shown in Table 6.5.
This section included also two, complementary, open ended questions. The first one was “What
did you most appreciate in the guide” and the second one “What did you find most difficult with
the guide”. 9 out of 12 (75%) participants chose to answer these questions. Tables 6.5 and 6.6
display the obtained answers. Finally, the scores obtained in a 1 to 4 scale are displayed in Table
6.7 and discussed in the conclusions’ section.

6.3.6 QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO THE COGNITIVE IMPACT

Due to the exploratory nature of the study, no formal experimentations were conducted as to the
cognitive impact. However it was thought useful to include some questions related with the postvisit effect. The first of the questions asked was whether participants remembered the number of
works included in the guide. 10 out of the 12 participants (83.33%) answered correctly more than
one month after the visit had taken place. 9 participants (75%) also remembered one of the artists
names, while 3 (25%) indicated that they remembered 1 artist but without mentioning a name.
Similarly, half of the participants mentioned one or more of the topics represented. Finally, none
of the participants answered trying to retrieve relevant documentation after the visit.

206

6.3.7 QUESTIONS ABOUT AN HYPOTHETICAL, FUTURE USE OF THE GUIDE

Lastly, a set of questions regarding a hypothetical future intention of using such a guide was
included in the survey. The first question was “Would you use such a guide, if it was available in
the museum?” The students could choose in between “yes”, “no” and “maybe”. However, the last
choice demanded by participants a justification of their answer. 44% answered “Yes” without
expressing any prerequisites, while the other 56% said “Probably”, under certain conditions. No
participant expressed directly that he/she would not use the guide. Table 6.8 resumes these open
ended answers.

Probably, it depends on the paintings
Probably, according to the exhibition (contemporary/classical)
Probably

If it was free and less bulky
Yes, If it was free
Yes, out of curiosity in a foreign country

Another subject on whom we wanted to have if not a grip, at least estimation, was the number of
paintings the visitors would like to have commented in a guide. 4 participants thought that a total
of about 10 paintings would be adequate. 2 others answered that they would like at about 2
paintings for each gallery or each period and style. 1 participant simply answered several, while
another 2 would be happy with less than 6. Finally 1 participant said that he would appreciate to
have approximately 40% of the totally exposed paintings, while another one asked at about 40.
The mean in this case is 10 paintings, a number that might correspond to the number of
comments a visitor would be willing to explore. The open ended questions “If you had any
expectations prior to your visit, please write them down” and “Is there any comment that you
would like to share with the conception and implementation team” did not yield any exploitable
answers.

6.3.8 CONCLUSIONS

6.3.8.1 Conclusions regarding the initial hypothesis about the test group profile
The results of the survey confirmed the initial hypothesis regarding the profile of the participants,
as occasional IT users, with no previous knowledge regarding Virtual and Augmented Reality
applications. The answers were also coherent with the hypothesis of studying a homogenous
group in terms of age, but with different museum visiting habits in terms of visiting frequency.
207

Under different circumstances all participants would have been considered as belonging to
frequent museum visitors; after all, they all volunteered to participate in the study and their
answers indicate that they visit museums more often in comparison with the average population
(Falk and Dierking, 1992). Regarding our study however, it is apparent that the Fine Arts students
visit museums far more often in comparison with the Social Sciences students, quite probably
because the studying and training curriculum of the first group encourages very frequent (more
than four times per year) museum and cultural institutions visiting. For this reason from this point
onwards we shall also refer to these two groups as “frequent” and “occasional” museum goers.
Museum visiting as a social activity was found to be more coherent with the Social Sciences
students, 2/3 of whom answered preferring visiting museums with family or friends. Whether
these differentiations in profile can be correlated with the overall acceptance of the guide is an
issue that will be further examined in section 6.3.8.4.

6.3.8.2 Use of interpretation material
A strong polarity was observed in the answers given as to whether participants generally use or not
interpretation material throughout the visit; only half of the participants answered that they always do so.
The answers were equally divided both between the two university groups as well as in between male and
female students. Despite the positive or negative answers collected for this question, all participants chose
to fill in the question regarding the interpretation material they are more susceptible to use.

As to the nature of the interpretation material used, text provided by the museum comes in 1st
place with 60%, followed by on site multimedia kiosks, museum web sites and printed guides of a
museum’s collection (20%), and finally audio guides (10%). Whether the preference over text is a
consequence of the museum reality or an explicit and conscious visitor interpretation choice will
be revisited in the interviews (6.4) and focus group (6.5) sections.

6.3.8.3 Ease of use and navigation
Interestingly, the best score obtained in this section of the survey was related with the ease of
spatial identification and localization of the commented works of art in the gallery space
(mean=3.4), obtained by a 58.3% of the participants that strongly agreed, with the remaining
41.7% mostly agreeing. Good scores were also obtained regarding the easiness of navigation
(mean=3.25). These results are particularly important for the overall assessment of the AR
character of the mobile application, as in terms of interface, navigation, both in the museum space
and in the content of the application, was built upon a consistent use of the AR metaphor.
208

A somewhat lower score was obtained when participants were asked to judge the overall easiness
of use of the guide (mean=3.08); we believe however that the additional equipment used for the
study, might have somewhat influenced the obtained score. The lowest score in this section was
observed in the statement regarding whether the “augmentation” of the true objects with virtual
ones facilitated the access to the content. Despite the fact that this question is strongly linked with
the much better performing assertions of the two first questions, the mean obtained was only 2.66,
with participants equally divided in between the “Mostly Agree”, “Somewhat Agree” and
“Somewhat Disagree” statements. This survey question therefore provides a tangible example of
the impact the formulation of a questionnaire might have on findings and results in surveys.

6.3.8.4 Attentional balance and user distraction
On of the key topics identified straight after the beginning of the project was related with the
introduction of the AR guide in the museum environment, especially in terms of distraction from
the real work of art and/or cognitive overload.
According to the results of the survey, it seems that such an issue exists. When participants were
asked whether the reference images used for the multimedia presentations in 2D or 3D interfered
with their appropriation of the contemplated painting or rather assisted them, the responses were
divided; half of the participants claimed that they were helped, with the other half being equally
divided between the “interference” choice and the open-ended option. Participants who chose the
latter answered that they were sometimes helped and sometimes not. Division was also observed
when participants were asked to position themselves on the negatively worded statement of
interference of the guide with their contemplation of a work of art (25% “Mostly agree”, another
33.3% “Somewhat Agree”, 33.3% “Somewhat Disagree” and 8.3% “Mostly Disagree”, average
score=2.25).
Further analysis and correlation of the answers obtained in this question with participants’ profiles
indicate that frequent museum goers, felt more distracted (score 3.4) in comparison with
participants visiting museum less often, who felt much less distracted by the use of the guide
(score 1.8). But this is not the only answer in which results between frequent and occasional
museum goers get greatly differentiated.
The mean obtained among the Social Sciences students when asked if the visiting experience was
better because of using the guide, was 3.5/4 against 2.33/4 obtained among the Fine Arts
Students. The same differentiation was observed in the question asking whether participants felt
209

having learned more as a result of using the guide. In a 1 to 4 scale, the mean obtained by the
Social Sciences students was 3.5 as in contrast with 2.33 obtained by the Fine Arts students.
Another question, asking participants to position themselves as to whether they better
comprehended and appreciated the commented paintings, also revealed differences among the
two groups: the mean for the students of Fine Arts was 2.83 and for the Social Sciences students
3.33.
One of the advantages of using the Likert scale is that apart from calculating the mean of the
examined group(s), it is also possible to add up all individual scores for each participant separately
(Kuniavsky, 2003). This process proved to be quite revealing regarding our two test groups. The
mean obtained by adding up the scores of each question for which the Likert scale was applicable
gave a mean of 2.96/4 for the Fine Arts students (lowest mean obtained: 2.85/4, highest mean
obtained 3.21/4) and 3.3/4 for the Social Sciences students (lowest mean obtained: 3/4, highest
mean obtained 3.64/4). Clearly, the overall attitude of the two test groups was not the same.
Possible reasons for that will be revealed in section 6.5, where the two Focus Groups sessions are
discussed.
It is also interesting to notice that students using a computer very often marked in a more
pronounced way their distraction from the real work of art (3.0 versus 2.25 for the rest of the
participants) as well as male in comparison with female (2.2 versus 3.3).

6.3.8.5 Edutainment, self assessment of (informal) learning and future use.
The statement asking participants whether they found the use of the guide playful achieved one of
the best scores of the survey (3.5), provoking thus less division, with all participants choosing the
“Mostly Agree” or “Somewhat Agree” option. This overwhelmingly positive attitude was also
reflected on another occasion, and more specifically in an open-ended question asking participants
the feature they most appreciated in the guide. 4 out of the 9 participants that responded, replied
that the feature the most appreciated was the “playful” character of the guide, while 3 other
implied it, as they qualified some of the Picasso content, directly provided by the museum
educators, as the most positive element of using the guide.
It is also interesting to check the answers on the statement “Using the guide helped me better
approach and appreciate the paintings”, where 11 out of 12 participants (91.7%) mostly or
somewhat agreed. The same encouraging results were also obtained when participants were asked
to evaluate whether they believe having learned more as a consequence of using the guide. We
210

were also interested in including some questions regarding the post-visit effect, like for example
the number of works included in the guide. Almost six weeks after the visit, 75% of the
participants were able to remember correctly. However even participants who didn’t could name
one or more of the subjects depicted and/or the associated artists.
Despite the altercation observed in other sections of the survey, all participants answered
positively when they were asked whether they would use such a guide in a museum. However one
has to notice that 7 out of the 12 participants included their own condition for that; among these
answers, two identify as a criterion a topic that was not formally introduced in the study, the
additional cost that sometimes is added to the museum ticket for the use of a multimedia guide.
Three other participants replied that their decision would depend on the included paintings,
another one that he would use it for sure, if travelling in another country, while 1 other that
he/she would use it if it was less bulky. Finally 1 participant defined as a criterion conducting a
museum not accompanied, but alone.

6.3.8.6 Content Effectiveness
Content effectiveness can apparently closely be related with the above mentioned topic of a
hypothetical, future use, intention. The statement regarding the “comprehensibility of the themes”
ranked 1st, with a score of 3.5. This was a very interesting result, as during the process of
conceptualization of the application, fears had been expressed as to whether the selected title for
each theme would be comprehensible. In addition one participant explicitly named one of the
themes included as his favorite element of the application, demonstrating consciousness of the
distinctive content of each theme.
A polarity was observed in the question regarding the length of the audio comments, which in
most cases exceeded the standard 1.30 minute audio guide comment: Half of the participants
found the audio recordings to be too long and the other half satisfactory. This result is self
speaking as to a certain need for personalization or customization of mobile museum guides so as
to fit several different visitors’ profiles. Unanimity is observed as to the length of the provided
texts and multimedia presentations with 91.7% of the participants judging them satisfactory. This
was also interesting as a result for the project stakeholders, as the feeling that the implementation
team shared was that the presentations were rather long. Cross-checking this result with the results
of the other evaluation methods employed will later highlight once again this issue.

211

Another interesting question was relevant with the ways participants used the multimedia guide
and its content. Despite the fact that all the media provided were eventually used by the students,
the audio content as well as the reference 2D and 3D images came on top with 66.7%, followed
by the texts (41.7%), the 2D or 3D multimedia presentations (33%) and the video (25%). This
finding becomes more interesting when examined together with the results obtained when
participants were asked to indicate what kind of interpretation material they usually use while
visiting, where the use of text was by far predominant over the use of other interpretation media
participants could choose from. Nevertheless, a point demanding attention is that the multimedia
character of the guide did not greatly affected the percentages of preference over text; it rather
augmented the percentages of preference regarding the audio and the multimedia sequences of the
mobile guide.

6.3.8.7 Other issues
Eventually, it is interesting to highlight some other details regarding the obtained answers, in
particular the answers obtained in two open-ended questions of the survey. The first one was “Is
there anything that you would wish the guide to do?” and the second one “Is there anything that
you would wish the guide not to do?”. The harvested comments were enlightening. A female
participant wrote down that she wishes the guide was handier, or that it could be placed
somewhere during the contemplation of the work of art, so that the guide does not “interfere” with
her contemplation of the painting. In the same direction, another participant answered that he
wished the guide was less heavy and provided shorter commentaries while a male student wished
the guide was even more interactive “showing the details directly on the painting”. Another comment was
that the guide should not “make us observe only the screen” and that “it should not be distributed to a very
young public, below 15 years old.” An uncommon comment was that the identification of the paintings
was much too easy and that the guide should not indicate immediately after entering a gallery,
which is the commented work. Finally, a participant gave the single word answer “camera”,
meaning that he did not approve the “scanning” of the museum galleries with the integrated
camera. A last remark is that according to the test group, the number of works to be included in a
guide need not be infinite. The most demanding participant requested a 40% of all exposed
paintings, while the numbers given by other participants varied in between 6 and 40, with 25% of
all participants giving the same “ten paintings” answer.

6.4 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS

6.4.1 ABOUT DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING ON THE RESULTS

The interviews conducted with the participants straight after the visit, turned out to give
interesting feedback regarding the use of the guide, and one not always foreseen. All records of
the interviews were transcribed (Appendix V) and coded using different tags into separate themes.
This process can be also visualized in Figure 6.6. The 1st column corresponds to the topics that
had been prepared by the researcher, the 2nd column to the list of topics that were eventually
brought up, and the 3rd column to the larger issues that were identified after the transcription and
coding of the interviews.
As already mentioned in section 5.4.5, the first questions of the interview were personal and used
more as a warm-up for the following questions. The “Museum Visiting” part of the interview was
then usually introduced. Discussing museum visiting habits allowed a better comprehension of the
circumstances under which young people visit museums and other cultural organizations. At the
same time participants had the opportunity to express themselves on a subject less peculiar than
the use of an AR-enabled mobile museum guide so as to arrive more confident on the questions

213

that would follow, having already established a link with more familiar situations, like, for example,
a casual museum visit.
This tactic seemed to work with most participants, giving thus very interesting -1st-personfeedback on some of the issues related with the use of the guide. Excerpts of the interviews are
presented below using as a criterion the diversity of the opinions expressed and the originality of
the answers given; attention was given to present the answers obtained in a complementary
manner for the comprehension of each issue.
Naturally, the issues discussed had some times attributes that could allow the classification under
more than one category. However, in order to eliminate repetitions, each identified issue is
presented only below one of the four following categories:
a) Findings related with museum visiting habits and strategies of approaching an exhibited object
b) Comments on the overall application content and its structure
c) Positioning of the subjects related to the interface and,
d) The interplay between the painting and the guide

Figure 6.6: Preparation, analysis and reporting of the semi-structured interviews
Regarding feedback related with the AR character of the proposed mobile guide, it is important to
notice that though the semi-structured interviews did not provide rich material, they nevertheless
served as a way for introducing the term and issue of use of AR technologies that would be later
examined through the questionnaires and the two focus group sessions.

6.4.2 PARTICIPANTS ON MUSEUM VISITING

6.4.2.1 Museum visiting as a social activity
Understanding why and how people young people visit museums could certainly encourage a
better understanding of the ideal mobile multimedia companion to a museum visit. For example,
as it is said that museum visiting is very often a social experience (Falk and Dierking, 1992),
several mobile museum guides projects foresee applications for visitors visiting in group (see also
section 2.2.5, where mobile museum guide projects are examined in relation with the social
context of the museum visit).
In the frame of the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes experimentations, nevertheless, opinions were
divided as to this topic. As it became apparent from the survey results, analyzed in the previous
section, the Fine Arts students mentioned more often than the Social Sciences students that they
prefer visiting alone; for them, approaching a work of art can be something “very personal” (Simon,
20 years old), while in case they share a visit they’d prefer that their co-visitor shares the same
background. On the other hand, for the Social Sciences students it seems that “visiting with others,
can be funny, because it allows seeing the impression a painting can make to different people” (Florence, 19 years
old). Nevertheless, even for the students preferring visiting with a companion, the lack of a covisitor would not prevent them from visiting a museum if they were particularly interested by an
exhibition.

6.4.2.2 Approaching the exhibited objects and use of interpretation material
An issue that was extensively discussed with participants was the procedure they follow when
conducting a museum visit, in order to approach, contemplate, “read”, comprehend, deepen and
maintain a souvenir of strong in attractive power exposed objects so as to examine how a mobile
guide could better support these tasks.
The first important observation is that visitors identified a need for documentation material in
cultural and exhibition spaces. For example, a female students of Fine Arts reported, regarding
contemporary art, that “… what irritates me in contemporary art, is that there is not an enormous offer in
terms of interpretation, so I find that annoying” (Marie-Laure 20 years old). Johan, another 20 year old
male student, admits that “I see a lot (of contemporary art) but I have many difficulties in understanding”
while another participant underlined the fact that even audio guides are far from being the rule in
most museums. An alternative and more wide-spread solution consists of museums providing

215

guided tours. For example, in the year 2000, out of the 1108 museums registered in France, 871
proposed at least a guided visit option for museum visitors (ASSEMBLÉE NATIONALE).
Why is it then that none of the participated students opted for the guided visit option of the
survey? Some main reasons for that were provided during the interviews session. A female
student, answered negatively as to whether she is tempted to follow guided visits: “I prefer that
alternative interpretation material is proposed to me, so that I can choose…I find that a guided visit is often a bit
too guided…the personal choice in a museum, passing from one painting to another, is important”. A male
student said that in comparison with a human guide, an audio or a multimedia guide “gives as the
possibility to go around and do what we want”. The importance of personal choice is also evoked by
another student “I like looking at the paintings and give my own answers, … trying to imagine what it (the
painting) represents… when they give me the answer, I do not necessarily agree, I do not always like it, sometimes
the explications given just don’t appeal to me… This is why I do not like guided visits and I prefer visiting on my
own, looking or discussing with the person I am visiting with. This is what I find interesting”.
This very personal bond of the museum visitor with a selected exhibit was also illustrated in the
words of a 20 year old student, from the Social Sciences department, who gave a detailed
description of his own way of approaching a painting: “There are three things in a painting. First of all
there is a feeling, what the painting transmits us. For example, the faces, the emotions, or everything else that belongs
to this category. Then there is the beauty. Hum…..The beauty both ways. The beauty with its philosophical sense or
what is represented. Is it a scene of war or another historic event? And the beauty in terms of aesthetics…Do I like
what I see or not? And the third point is the technique.” In the same spirit, a very reactive young man
studying Fine Arts, mentioned more than once during his interview that a visitor should “learn to
ask questions that are his own” and learn to “see the things for real and live through their reality” (Florient, 22
years old).
When one comes close enough to contemplate a painting, here is what some of the students said
that follows: “First, I observe a lot the painting with attention, then I read the information next to it, if there is
interpretation material it is even better” (Florence, 18 years old). -“I stop longer before the paintings I like…”
(Elise, 21 years old). In case text is the only available interpretation material “…the first thing that I
do is to take the museum brochures … I take a look quickly so as to have a personal opinion on what I am
watching before I read, but then I take the time to read and I go back to see elements that interest me and that I
might have missed…” (Marie-Laure, 20 years old). Another student replied that “I might not read the full
content…(but)…when there is (interpretation material), I take it…”.

216

The virtues of having alongside museum-provided text as interpretation material came on surface
on many occasions. A student mentioned “I prefer guides in form of a book, I like reading (so as) to
understand what I am watching”. The same meaning is conveyed by another participant saying “I prefer
taking my time by myself to read a text, because when we have only the audio, we retain some things but other things
are put aside, while with the text, we can take our time”.
Finally, an unanticipated way of getting more information about selected exhibits was brought up
by two male Fine Arts students, who mentioned that they are always equipped with a pen and a
notebook. Whenever they spot an interesting work of art, they note the artist and the title in order
to search, more information after the visit.

6.4.3 ON THE CONTENT AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE APPLICATION

Another distinct group of questions was clearly related with the content of the mobile museum
application, in terms of available themes, content structure and comprehension. The question that
was repeatedly asked to participants was whether the structure of the content was clear and
comprehensible. The spontaneous answers coming over and over were largely positive; all
participants made the connection with the different themes available and expressed personal
preferences as to the themes included (description, technique, iconography, artist and context).
Several also remarked that “we can choose the information we want, and then we choose as well the order”
(Florence, 18 years old). A participant stated that “If I had retaken the tour alone, I would do the
“description”, the “analysis” and the “context” but I might have not done the “technique”, except maybe the 3rd
painting, the one that was very dark (Amaury Duval)” (Simon, 20 years old), while a girl said that though
she found “very interesting to see how the painting was made”, there were things “interesting…but maybe not
necessary”. However, relevant with this last point, another participant found that “It was good to have
different thematic axes, because if I need to see only the technique for one painting, I do not have to pass through the
full content”.
The pictograms chosen for each available medium were also judged “self-explanatory” with the
exception of the pictogram chosen for the slideshow: “The slideshow was not clear, because the slides were
black in color. I understood it after. While the headphones, we understand what it means, and the video the same,
we understand what it stands for. The slideshow was the less self-explanatory.”
Another aspect of the content was related with the cognitive overload provoked by the content
and the application. The interviews helped a lot in gathering information on this issue, which had
not been included in the survey and was by its nature, very difficult to be identified through the
217

observations. The cognitive overload issue appeared progressively, as several students expressed
themselves on that point, though they were not explicitly demanded to do so. In most of the
occasions, this issue was closely linked with the application content, by many participants. For
example, after asking one of the candidates whether the structure of the content and the themes
present for each painting were comprehensible, she answered “Yeah…but there were too many things
present at the same time and it is not easy to retain all at once…but otherwise the content was rich, there were many
things”. Another participant, when asked to add any additional commentaries, said “Well…I liked it
a lot, it is nice having all this information, but then of course we can not absorb everything at once”. Another
aspect of the same problem is revealed in the phrase of a male participant who said “…there were
only one or two moments that I was lost, I don’t remember when exactly, in the text or in the audio, in the
audio…I mean it went too fast, with words that are not employed frequently, so the time to comprehend the words,
and try to understand, there was a moment that I was lost…but otherwise it looked clear and simple”.

6.4.4 ON THE INTERFACE

6.4.4.1 On painting identification
Was it easy to use the guide? That was another question for which we wanted participants to
express themselves and one particularly related with the AR metaphor used in the design and
implementation of the guide. Some found categorically easy (intuitive) the overall use of the guide
and the navigation. Others added that “We need some time to adapt…” (Marie-Laure, 20 years old)
but “…once we understand how it works” (Julien, 22years old) “it goes fast”. “…We go to the left or we go
down, and we validate. So for me using it was really easy” (Johan, 21 years old).

Identifying the

commented works was also a subject evoked, but none of the participants considered having met
a problem with the identification. Moreover, one of the subjects stated that finding the
commented works in the museum galleries was much too easy, and advised making the detection
more “difficult”, maybe “playful” (Johan, 21 years old).
Having to “fix” with the web camera the painting so that the virtual overlays appear, was noted by
at least two participants. “Is there really a need to take (capture) a real time video in order to “fix” (make
appear) the content of a painting?” (Simon, 20 years old). “I would like it more if we didn’t have to move”
(Marine, 18 years old). The camera issue was also mentioned in a single word answer also in the
survey. This element is important as it reveals that for some of the participants the task to be
executed, so that the virtual overlays appear, was understood, but the interaction metaphor was
not as well accepted.

218

6.4.4.2 On interface elements necessitating change or amelioration
Admitting that the identification of the commented works was easy, straightforward or intuitive,
which were the characteristics or details that were explicitly mentioned as subject to enhancements
and ameliorations, from the point of view of the test group?
The observations regarding the delivery of the audio came first as remark from the test group. A
female user, when asked which would be the ameliorations she would advice, said: “First of all I
would put the sound in the ears (I would use headphones) and then I would rather have something handier so that
we don’t have something that separates us from the painting. And also having the possibility to place the guide
somewhere…then we could be confronted with the painting.”
Another comment regarding the audio was related with the absence of a “pause”, “rewind” or
“forward” control for the audio sequences. The problem was partially identified by a male
participant who stated: “the return button…I found this a little bit strange, I mean…hmm… I know that…
I like a lot actually go fast with things, go back, go forward, see another painting and it’s true that I missed a little
bit the back button.”
The font size adopted for some of the presentations as well as the repetitive character of a text
and an audio presentation for one of the paintings (lack of consistency) was marked with a sense
of humor by a male participant (21 years old), who described this way his experience: “The text was
very small and I did not have my glasses, I try to read it and then I pass on the audio, and I realize that it is the
same thing…”.
Finally, one participant mentioned that he was initially confused by the fact of having to use the
touch sensitive “pause button” and the two UMPC buttons. More specifically the participant
reported: “The fact that there is also the touch-sensitive screen, the “pause” button, is a bit distracting…since the
guide has to be hold with both hands… touching the guide like that is a bit difficult and we don’t know when to use
the touch sensitive screen or the button.”

6.4.4.3 On positive interface elements
A distinct group of statements was related with interface and application characteristics that
seemed to have a certain appeal to the students.
The presence of alternative media revealing information about the paintings seemed to be
appreciated by many participants. “I don’t use audio guides, but at the same time today, the fact of having
this, I was happy not to read…because when I found myself in front of Picasso, it looked less intrusive (the guide),
219

because there were the images that passed, there were multiple ways to do it…” (Florence, 18 years old).
Another female student (19 years old), expressing herself on the same topic, said: “Well already, I
found very interesting the fact of having the image and the text, and that the text is active, I liked it more than the
audio”. The delivery of textual information by means of a computer screen was positively
mentioned by the same student, a bit later on. “You see, recently I was at the exhibition at the … (center of
contemporary art, in Rennes) this week, so they gave as a text that was without images, without anything. We are
much less attracted to read in comparison with the multimedia guide, so this way it is much easier to read… It was
much more interesting than having only text”. Another female participant added that “I find it very
interesting to have other things than only the paintings, and I think this is especially true for people not at ease with
paintings and museum visiting…whatever is visual, is very good”. (Charlotte, 22 years old).
Zooming and highlighting some of the paintings’ details was also mentioned during several
interviews. A female participant (19, years old), said: “What I liked on the first (painting), was the
possibility to zoom in the details…because these are things we usually don’t see, and moreover, as they are
explained…I mean…we see the painting differently...it becomes not a painting but… a group of smaller images.”
Moreover, other participants added that though they enjoyed this characteristic they would prefer
that it becomes more present “I would like the possibility to be able to zoom more in the paintings” (female
participant, 19 years old). “Otherwise regarding the additional pictures provided, when we are in the description
of the painting, I was expecting to see something more interactive, where the image would move, where there would be
arrows or indications, a zoom-in or things that will move and change on the image itself…”(Simon, 20 years
old).

6.4.5 ON USER DISTRACTION

A word coming often in visitor’s comments was that the guide was “funny” and “playful”. This is
normally a positive attribute for an application whose destination is to be used in a multisensory,
informal learning and entertainment environment. “It is true that using the guide was quite playful, this is
not bad, and then it allows us having interpretation material on hand” (Elise, 21 year old). “It was playful as a
thing, and the fact of being able to pass by any information that does not appeal to us is very good”. (Marine, 18
years old).
But when one of the participants was asked whether he would recommend the use of the guide,
he said “Well, one has to develop his critical senses… (so)…it depends on the persons”. Possible reasons for
that are provided by the following sayings. According to one participant “…the fact of having the
device on hands makes as watch it. Well then, in the commentaries there are phrases like “look at the painting”,

220

but maybe finally we watch it less. There is an intermediate, I would say between us and the painting even
materially…” (Marlene, 22 years old).
The interplay between watching the real painting and using the multimedia guide was also
mentioned by another participant. “Well, it’s true that we juggle a bit between the two, the painting and the
device, but that is what the device proposes…” (Simon, 20 years old). The attitude one has to show in
such a case is to “…be careful in watching also the painting on its own and take the time to see the things”
(Benjamin, 21 years old). The creation of juxtaposed feelings regarding the multimedia
presentations are also illustrated by the statement of another participant “There was a moment where
we had to listen something and at the same time search the different elements on the painting…that was very
interesting because at other times it is too much; and we do not look the painting but we are fixed on the device,
images pass by and in reality whether we find ourselves in front of a painting or in front of a computer, it would be
the same”.(Johan, 21 years old). According to a 3rd participant (Elise, 21 years old), “Well, I don’t
know if it should be too playful, because, it is already playful so then it can become too much, because at the
beginning there was also the aspect “Oh, it’s cool, I am looking for the painting…”, then I can click to whatever I
want” and then it becomes too playful and we can click wherever without really listening. Because, moreover, at the
beginning, as we don’t know we click a bit everywhere, on all themes, but not everything interests us, so you see…”

6.4.5 DISCUSSION

The short semi-structured interviews were of capital importance for the experimentations
conducted in the Museum of Fine Arts; first, they turned out as a first barometer regarding the
impact and the first impressions from using the application. Secondly, they allowed the author to
get to know better the profile of both group of participants so as to better prepare the following
evaluation sessions, the survey and the focus group; Thirdly, they allowed the clarification of other
issues that arouse in other evaluation sessions. A good example is relevant with the hesitation of
the subjects as to their participation in guided tours, while visiting museums. Finally, they gave the
possibility to smoothly introduce participants to the notion of mobile AR that would be further
discussed and explored during the focus group sessions.
6.5 THE FOCUS GROUPS

6.5.1 INTRODUCTION

The two focus groups were conducted approximately 6 weeks after the visit, and brought together
in two sessions the students of each University department that had participated in the study. The
recorded videos were analyzed using the free “ELAN” video annotation software and the most
221

representative quotes were translated from French to English (Appendix III). All patterns and
themes discussed were identified but attention was also given to silences, tensions, disagreements
and humour, often revealing crucial bits of information.
As with previous evaluation sessions, the topics were brought up by the moderator starting from
the most general – in our case museum visiting habits and strategies of approaching selected
exposed objects- and gradually progressing to the more specific, the use of the mobile AR
multimedia guide.
In contrast with the goals of previous conducted experimental evaluation, the Focus Groups had
also the intention to bring up the topic of AR, and its possible future uses, especially in the
museum setting. The positioning and the feelings of the test group as to the notion of AR broadly
speaking were judged equally important. For this reason, a set of three posters (Appendix VI) with
other AR applications were presented to both groups as a stimulus to a discussion.
The prepared for the Focus Groups agenda of topics to be discussed was the following:
1) Museum visiting, museum visiting habits and use of interpretation media once engaged in the
museum visit
2) Interpretation media available in the museum vs. interpretation media available in the guide
3) The AR character of the application
A short improvisation exercise, consisting of asking participants to spontaneously write down on
“sticky notes” notes some “must” and “must have not” features of an ideal mobile guide, was also
proposed just before the end of each Focus Group session.
The presentation of the data gathered by both focus groups starts with an introductory note for
each group that resumes the timeline of the themes introduced. Some general remarks are briefly
presented for each focus group at the end of each relevant section.

6.5.2 THE FINE ARTS STUDENTS (FREQUENT MUSEUM VISITORS)

6.5.2.1 Focus Group Timeline
The session was conducted during midday so the overall duration of the process could not exceed
75 minutes, which is the minimum amount of time normally required for conducting a Focus
Group. At the opening of the session, the procedure was once again presented to participants
222

together with an encouragement to be as sincere and spontaneous as possible and the reassurance
that nobody will be judged.
As already reported in previous sections, this 1st group of students visits museums very frequently.
Therefore the first issue introduced, was the kind of interpretation media participants use when
engaged in a museum visit and their way of approaching a selected work of art. However, unlike
the answers provided by the same group of participants in the survey, the majority of the students
claimed not to use interpretation material in the museum. The question therefore was rephrased
as: “If you had to give your professional opinion as to interpretation media to be used for a less
experienced public, what would you advise?”.
A bit later the discussion focused on the media participants met in the multimedia guide, as well as
positive and negative characteristics. This question also had to be rephrased as “what would you
change if you made part of the conceptualization and implementation team?”. Last but not least
the posters were presented to the participants who were encouraged to share feelings, opinions
and ideas regarding AR and its potential applications. The main themes and patterns that emerged
during the discussion of these issues are presented below.

6.5.2.2 Use of interpretation media and strategies of approaching a work of art
Participants of the 1st group self-referred to themselves as initiated museum visitors on several
occasions. For example, while talking about interface aspects, one participant said that regarding
the initiated in history of art group he is representing, accessing quickly a maximum of
information in a minimum of time is crucial. Another participant said “Maybe we are more at ease
(with works of art) or we have more sensitivity…I think it is also our curiosity that makes as have this perception
of things”. In several other occasions participants differentiated themselves from the average or less
experienced museum visitor profile.
The discourse held over the 1st topic introduced in this session, the use of interpretation media in
the museum and the ways of approaching a work of art, was long and passionate to a degree that
sometimes necessitated the intervention of the moderator.
Two were the most important themes that emerged from this section. The 1st one is the variations
observed regarding visiting habits and preference over different interpretation media. The 2nd one
was that several candidates questioned the “raison d’être” and the actual use of these media in the
museum. The following excerpts are illustrative.

223

The first student to talk was Florien, a 22 years old male student. Florien visits museums very
often as most of the students of this group. He usually looks for exhibit related information after
the visit and for him all media, books, Internet, video, are good for that. He does not need to take
notes because if he likes something “it stays engraved” in his memory. For him, “Everything happens in
front of the object”.
The convictions of Florien did seem to influence a female student of this group that used the
same exact words, “it all happens in front of the painting”, adding however that, as opposed to Florien,
she usually takes notes and if there is available text she might consult it. The need to take notes
was also evoked by a 3rd, male, participant. A somewhat different approach is revealed by the
position of Marie-Laure, a female, 20 years old student. “I always start by reading texts before I go to an
exhibition. Personally I prefer taking the information before and watch the work after and then discuss about it.”
Her saying provoked an immediate reaction from the part of two of her colleagues. The first one
said: “Yes but in this case you are more than oriented when you enter in an exhibition.” A 2nd one added: “if
you go and start to bother for what this or the other person or art historian said, your approach is not personal, you
will eventually have the a priori of these persons. Somehow it will alter your subjectivity and your perception”.
The female student whose sayings provoked these reactions provided an interesting counter
argument: “Yes, but at the same time sometimes, like for example, in the exhibition [name of the exhibition] that
I saw the previous weekend, it was the opposite. There was no explication at all, there were only words on each
stand, so visitors kept asking themselves what the objects were doing there and what was the relation between the one
and the other. It is important to have some information so as to be able to “read” the work of art. … it is
important to appreciate something while looking at it…”
But what about other media, like interactive multimedia kiosks, audio guides or guided visits?
According to Benjamin (male student, 21 years old) “whenever there is a multimedia kiosk I start taking a
distance”. As to audio guides, one of the participants clearly mentioned that she never uses it: “I
would not like to have audio. I am more attracted by text. The audio, I never use it, it gives me a headache after 5
minutes, and then, why bother with the description of a work if you have it in front of you? I ‘d rather have
information on the artist or on what he made”. The way audio is sometimes used by the large public, was
vividly described and mimicked by Florient (Figure 6.7). “For me, the audio perturbs. I was in an
exhibition the other day in Paris. People take a device, they pass before the works, they watch and when they see a
little number, they go straight for that and they are literally scotched in front of it, and when the comment finishes,
hop, they go…I can ask from these people what it is that they remember from the exhibition….they haven’t seen
anything.”

6.5.2.3 On the content and the structure of mobile museum guide applications
Despite the turbulence provoked by the discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of using a
mobile guide in the museum setting, a theme that imbued the whole session, even the more
reserved students articulated their feelings and ideas about the ways of providing and presenting
exhibit related information. While discussing about museum interpretation media and strategies of
approaching works of art, Julien, a male student, said that there are things on which he would like
to have information, for example a description, but that regarding feelings or senses that an object
evokes, he would rather trust his senses. The topic was further analyzed by another participant:

Figure 6.7: A Fine Arts student mimicking the way audio guides are sometimes used in museums ( ”They are
almost scotched in front of it”)
“I would advise the use of the guide in case it sets the good questions. We talked about this during the interview, if
you remember… I said that the museum educator who was present in the museum the other day with a group of
children, asked: “What do you feel?” For me this is very important, because when we go to a museum the important
thing is to live through objects and things and cultivate our sensitivity…People that are amateurs and do not have
solid knowledge, will not know how to set these questions on their own. There is obviously a reason, if we like or
don’t like something.” A bit later, he also added: “It is this kind of questions that should appear in the guide,
the ones that encourage visitors to ask themselves questions about what they feel, the ones that cultivate their
sensitivity not just “I go to a multimedia kiosk and I learn what the artist has to say”, not that. Because the artist
sets the things but also wants to provoke feelings and senses.”
Here is what another participant said on the same subject: “I agree on that. It is necessary to ask the right
questions, not just say: “this is the reason for which the painting was made”…not to reveal everything at
once…make people feel the need to look for information on their own.” Four other participants agreed; only
one student noted that not everybody entering a museum will have the will or the time afterwards
to try to search relative information.
225

6.5.2.4 On the content of the mobile museum guide application
As to the way this principle was employed in the tested prototype here is what another participant
said:
“Me, what I felt is that everything was given, we were not concentrated on the object, on what happened in front of
our eyes…OK with the multimedia kiosks, but personally I am not fond of guides…but if this is the case maybe
after the exhibition…”
As a solution to that, one of the opinions expressed was that “giving information either at the beginning
or the end would make visitors set the right questions…as the principle of a museum is to show things but also help
people develop their own feelings regarding the objects exposed”.
Regarding the content of the guide, interestingly, one of the issues that were introduced by
participants themselves was related with the matter of personalization or customization. For one
of the female participants, providing the content in several languages is a very important issue as
well as targeting one or several groups, for example children. The example of children as a target
group for the specific application was also brought up by another participant “Addressing it (the
guide) to a specific visitor profile is important, for example, children might need to focus more on colors, or sketch
something so as to represent a detail…in this case the guide would need to be playful. And there are also other
categories of people that might need a guide like this”. Later on, the same participant provided another
idea, to be able to “transform the painting on the screen, like changing the colors and see how we can transform
the painting and then be able to print that and take it home to have a small souvenir of what we did”.
However, the idea of a virtual visitor intervention on a work of art did not provoke unanimity
among the other students. One of them said “Maybe I am a bit old fashioned, but I think that a work of
art should not be touched because there would be a risk to overdo it. I ‘d rather have a practical guide rather than
funny”.
This preposition found another supporter who said that: “…playfulness is already part of the perception
of a work of art. We play even if we don’t interact directly with the work of art. There is a playful part in the
perception of things, and this way of playing is personal. There are fantastic works of art that invite people to
interact with them.” Additionally the participant expressed his fears as to young children using the
application in a clear and concise way: “…well I think that kids could be manipulated, it would be only
game… If we impose to kids to understand and perceive the world of art like that…well they could as well stay
home to visit virtual museums…This is what I want to say.”

226

6.5.2.5 On positive and negative application elements
As the dialogue regarding the use of interpretation material did not cease, after all participants had
expressed their feelings, a re-orientation of the discussion towards the actual application tested,
was judged essential. Participants were asked what would be their personal touch regarding the
application if they made part of the implementation team.
The first problem to be evoked was once again related with the audio delivery. A participant said
“the audio, include headphones or something like that, in any case, for me it was the audio that did not function
well”. He then added “I did not quite understand this system of “we take a video of something”, but anyway as
the painting is in front of us we do not need to look the work on the screen. To have to fix (with the camera) the
work so as to see it after on the screen, I found this a bit annoying.” For another student the application
makes the visitor “fix the display”. This last participant, however, managed to turn his critique into
an idea of how he would like the guide to be modified. “Maybe what should be done would be to fix the
painting but then (after the detection) make it disappear from the screen so that we can choose the themes. Like that
we would be obliged to look at the real painting.”
At this point, the previously speaking participant intervened once again, pointing out the “pause”
button problem: “navigation is very important and as there was not always a back button we could not always go
back at any moment”.
Another question introduced in the Focus group, was whether during the use of the guide,
participants experienced any kind of emotion. The first response was related with the content and
the presentations provided by the museum educators for the Picasso painting or -in participants’
words- “the child approach in the work of Picasso, to see the power point with the content elements that appear
progressively makes the reading of the painting more interesting”.
Regarding the length of the presentations and as opposed to the overall good results obtained by
the survey, one male participant said: “Maybe some passages need to be shorter, as sometimes they were quite
long…as we already knew some things on the paintings, not everything interests us, so we will not look at
everything…the best thing would be to be concise and give the maximum of information quite quickly, because
(while on the visit) we did two themes and then we felt like going to another painting as we had already stayed a long
time before on one painting”. The level of detail of some of the presentations was also mentioned by
another participant. “It is good to have interpretation material…but maybe not this abundance of information,
at the same time that we watch the painting, but leave a mystery side, for example, receiving information without
knowing which work it accompanies and try to guess”.

227

Another compelling idea that arouse during this part of the process was linked with extending the
visit beyond the museum physical space as one participant propose to “keep in memory the information
and then provide it (to the visitor) at the end of the visit, in a digital storage media or something like that”.

6.5.2.6 Reaction towards AR and its use in the museum setting.
The last part of the Focus Group was dedicated to a discussion around AR as an emerging
technology. Participants of both groups were shown a set of images illustrating other AR
applications (Appendix 6). The reactions from the 1st Focus Group were very vivid (Figure 6.8),
while viewing the photos provoked laugh from the part of some participants. The sayings of the
following two participants are indicative as to the very reserved if not negative reaction that was
provoked. Benjamin, for example, said: “I find interesting watching all that, however if I go to a museum it is
not so as to see something through glasses. I am OK with the principle of receiving information, but for the senses
(the feelings) if we all put glasses…It is not possible, we will have a view where everything would be integrated, a
vision already constructed”. For a 2nd participant “The people that will start using these things, will not be able to
do without them, they will not have the mood to go and search for things themselves.” Finally a 3rd participant
made a comparison with the extent to which mobile phones have become an indispensable
accessory of our everyday life. “I think that there is a need for a medium that will help people develop this
curiosity, because if we invite people at this comfort, go to a museum, put on glasses, and a pair of headphones, the
day they will not have that they will be lost…like it now happens with our mobile phones, when we don’t have
them”.

6.5.2.7 General remarks and conclusions resulting from the 1st Focus Group
There are several remarks that have to be made regarding the frequent museum goers Focus
Group. The first one is the influence of one of the male participants over the other present
students. Either the way the participant expressed himself was very successful as to what other
participants felt, or the conviction by which he expressed himself had an impact on other
participants. An argument towards the second hypothesis is provided by the fact that the survey
results found half of the focus group participants to admit that they usually use interpretation
material once engaged in a museum visit. However, during the Focus Group, only one of these
three participants explicitly explained why and how she does use textual information.

228

Figure 6.8: Reactions provoked by the AR posters presented

As already pointed out by the survey results, the Fine Arts students were quite critical as to the
possible side effects the use of a mobile multimedia guide could provoke. However, the critique
expressed for other interpretation media, such as audio guides or museum provided texts,
provides a more general framework under which the hesitations regarding the possible use of a
multimedia guide should be examined.
A second important remark has to do with the way of ending the session. The issue of AR, lastly
introduced provoked a strong emotional reaction from the part of the candidates. Once the first
three expressed their reservation, the remaining students did not judge essential to position
themselves. Finally, it should be noted that the presence of our corresponding museum curator
might also have a slight effect on the way participants expressed themselves as to their relation
with museum visiting.

229

6.5.3 THE SOCIAL SCIENCES STUDENTS (OCCASSIONAL MUSEUM VISITORS)

6.5.3.1 Focus Group Timeline
The timeline followed resembled the timeline followed for the 1st Focus Group with one single
exception: Because of the reaction provoked by the AR posters shown shortly before the end of
the 1st Focus Group, the 2nd FG session started with an introduction on AR for which the same
series of posters were demonstrated, then put aside in order to proceed with the proposed agenda.
Another important difference as to the timeline, is that the available time for conducting the 2nd
Focus Group was extended, by approximately 15 to 20 minutes.

6.5.3.2 Museum Visiting and the Issue of Museum Interpretation
The 1st warm up question directly addressed to the participants was about the reasons for which
they might visit or not museums often. Several reasons were identified: among them, the price of
the entrance ticket, the lack of time, as according to several participants one has to take time to
visit. A female participant argued that museum visiting necessitates an initiation and it is not
always a “spontaneous initiative…It is like going to the theater, if you do not take the habit while you are young
you will not go when you grow up”. As to museum visiting as a social activity, some participants
responded that they enjoy sharing their visit in order to exchange opinions and ideas, while others
said that they prefer visiting alone.
Very quickly, the issue of interpretation also arouse. Put by one of the participants “we often hesitate
to go because we are not adequately informed and once in front of a work we feel a bit limited”. Another
participant defined the missing kind of information as the one that make someone better “see the
work and appreciate it” or as a 3rd participant said information to “understand the works, because even if you
are initiated that does not necessarily mean that you understand all kind of works of art”. When participants
were further encouraged to talk on how they feel faced at a situation like this, one of them
answered that “we do not feel at the right place”.
Not all participants agreed on that matter. A male participant differentiated his attitude and said
that “personally I am not bothered, even if I don’t understand, for the pleasure of my eyes; I am not blocked to go to
a museum and see things without explanation. Then I can create my own story and I am happy” (Johan, 21 years
old). As a response, one of the female participants that had previously also identified this issue
repositioned herself, saying that “having an explanation, sometimes guides our vision of a work of art”.

230

6.5.3.3 Interpretation material used and strategies of approaching a work of art
The next issue introduced was relative with the media that are usually available in the museum and
the media that were present in the multimedia guide. All media, namely text, audio, video
projections, paper guides, human guides, the World Wide Web and multimedia kiosks were
identified by the participants.
The following topic introduced aimed to identify how this 2nd group of students usually proceeds
if attracted by a particular work of art. Taking photos as a souvenir, or retain the name of the artist
and look for related information after the visit were some of the first answers obtained. As the
museum of Fine Arts in Rennes also provides two multimedia kiosks, the students were asked
whether they had already used them. With the exception of one participant who said being aware
of their existence but not particularly attracted by them, none of the students had given a try to
the multimedia kiosks though they had already visited more than once the Museum of Fine Arts in
Rennes.

6.5.3.4 On positive and negative application elements
The next question aimed at encouraging participants in identifying characteristics and elements
that they liked or did not like in the tested application. Regarding the content, a female participant
(Elise, 21 years old) said that she found very funny and interesting the fact that infrared and
ultraviolet photos of a painting were included allowing to locate later modifications and that she
enjoyed the details that jumped out of the painting. As opposed to the augmented details, no other
participant shared the same enthusiasm for the infrared and ultraviolet pictures.
The issue of audio delivery was also brought up very quickly by one female participant (Marine, 18
years old) and made also other participants agree that it could be better if the audio was delivered
by a headset. At least two participants mentioned, while spontaneously mimicking their moves
during the visit, that as they had to approach the device closer to their head so as to better hear,
they could not see the images that passed by, during some of the multimedia applications (Figure
6.8c-6.8d).
A related issue discussed was whether they would prefer a single or double audio headset. Most
participants said they would prefer a double headset “because the quality of the sound would be better”,
but one participant clearly explained that she would appreciate a single headset as she does not like
being isolated from the environment: “With a double headset you hear nothing else at all…and personally I
am stressed not to hear what is going on around me”.
231

Diverse opinions were observed even on the subject of whether holding the guide was tiring or
not (Figure 6.8a-6.8b). However the most interesting result of this remark is that some participants
demonstrated a clear understanding of the role of the “pause” button as a mean of freezing the
video and the virtual overlays that appeared around the painting on the screen. This was
demonstrated by the fact that they asked other participants who said that holding the guide was
tiring, whether they used the “pause” button, for taking a rest.
Regarding the presence and the use of the different media in the guide a female participant
indicated, with a negative connotation, that she was not expecting to find text, given that
alternative media -such as audio, video, slideshows or augmented views of the painting- were
included in the guide. Exactly as observed in Focus Group 1, not all participants agreed on the
importance of each medium employed. For example regarding text, one female participant stated:
“Personally, I prefer the text, because I can concentrate more easily, and I could not hear very well the audio
contents, while with texts, if there was something I could not understand, I could reread it; it is much simpler like
that” .
Another issue that emerged was the interplay between the real work and the guide. Johan, a 20
year old male student, mentioned that at times “we were with our eyes fixed on the screen and not on the
painting, so I told myself that if I was home in front of my computer visiting virtually the museum, it would be the
same. At times I was forgetting the painting that was in front of me”. Another participant said that “having
the computer between us and the work, made that sometimes we were not watching the painting…I’d like to be able
to place the guide somewhere and just watch the painting”.

232

Figure 6.9: Participants imitating uncomfortable positions while using the guide
As in contrast with the discussion held during the 1st Focus Group regarding this issue, two
participants of the 2nd Focus Group expressed their disagreement with this view. One of them said
“I did not have this impression, … especially with the description we could hear the commentary and then see the
work for real with all its details”. The other disagreeing participant said that “I was not blocked on the
screen, because I was switching from the screen to the painting and vice versa”. A possible solution to this
problem, heard also during the 1st Focus Group, was to make the painting disappear from the
display after the detection and leave on screen only the themes.
The issue of distraction arouse once again further on during the Focus Group shortly after the
brainstorming regarding other possible applications or functions that could be embedded in the
guide.
Participant 1: Well I think that (if the guide is too playful), it biases the visit, because from the moment we start
playing we forget the things we saw.
Participant 6: Yes...

233

Participant 1: Today I have few souvenirs of what I learned the day of the visit though I remember there were
many things I liked, so by focusing too much on the playful side, we loose the actual information.
Participant 5: It depends because there are things that can develop other things...the comments can help you
develop your critical spirit, do we agree or not, we automatically set the question to ourselves, so as to form our own
opinion.
When, a bit later on, participants were asked what their general impression from their experience
was and whether they believe that the museum should invest in a guide like that, they said:
Participant 2: Well then we have to see whether we have to pay for it or not, because if it costs 10 euros… Then,
I would not put this kind of thing in between children’s hands…There were special guides for that in the museum
that manage to create a dialogue with the children…I would not want to imagine all these children with their little
headset and their little device…they should be at least 15 years old… for children, it is better to encourage guided
visits…
Participant 2: It is true it demands concentration and maybe not all kind of persons could stay at the guide (the
content) all the time.
As to the easiness of painting identification, one of the participants shared with the other
members of the group a problem he had also mentioned during the interview.

Participant 3:

The disadvantage that I found is that we did not really look around us, and the reason for which

I was deceived was that right after we entered the gallery, the device immediately detected the painting. It was too
easy. I would like that the guide detects the work once we are closer, let’s say from a distance of 1 meter from the
painting, then we show him the work and it says “This is the painting... ” . Like that we would have the time to
also see the other (non commented) paintings...a kind of “walk around” mode…I was deceived not to have to look
for the painting!
Participant 6: I don’t agree with you. For me the identification was not that easy…
Participant 5: Yes, but isn’t it a bit the context of the particular visit? It is a prototype we were testing. In case
we were in a real museum visit, I would be looking with more time other paintings and I would chose the ones that
interest me. It is true we were focused on the guide but it as greatly the (experimentation) context that made that.

234

Finally, another disadvantage discussed by the participants was that of the selective inclusion and
therefore also exclusion of works of art available for consultation on the guide.
Participant 4:

I think we were more attracted by the commented works, so maybe unconsciously you pay less

attention on other works
Participant 4: While if all the paintings were inside, it would be ourselves choosing what we want, so this way we
would look only what would be of more interesting to us.
Participant 3: It is true, that if all paintings were included this problem would stop being a problem.

6.5.3.5 Reaction towards AR and its use in the museum setting.
At least two times during the discussion, participants expressed the opinion that they were
expecting something even more interactive. This was a good starting point for reintroducing AR
and its potential as a mean of orientation, navigation and interaction. More specifically participants
were asked to try to make an abstraction and imagine that their display is not a computer screen
but a pair of AR see-through goggles. The first reaction came from a male student that
spontaneously completed one of the sentences used by the moderator.
Participant 3: Do you mean that everything would happen on the painting? I think that with a pair of glasses we
would have more the impression of watching the painting as well as the information that comes to be added on it.
But then again we’d have to try.
His saying provoked a reaction from a female student who said:
Participant 1:

I think I would not like that at all, because I would have the impression of having something

introduced between me and the painting, it would not be my eyes that would watch, and they would be filtered by
something. I would feel trapped even if I could deactivate the added information.
Participant 2: Yes but the glasses could be removed…
Participant 3:

I think that we would have to try whether it is the painting you see or whether you have the

impression of being in front of a PC.
Participant 1: Yes, but knowing that there are things that will pass in front of your eyes, even if it is (the glasses)
transparent, there would be something in front of your eyes. This something would be imposed to you and you would
have to look at it.
235

Participant 3:

It is what is happening with the GPS actually, there are some devices that can project the

information right in front of you while you are driving, I think it is something like that.
Participant 1: Yes but I want to see my own reality, if they talk to me about Augmented Reality I just don’t
want it to be augmented.
Participant 4: Or at least be able to choose
Participant 1: Yes, exactly.
The silence was then followed by a set of ideas regarding alternative ways of using AR in the
museum.
Participant 1:

Eventually maybe we could project something…with a video projector that would display the

information and a mirror that would send back the image to us reversed, with all the information. But in that case
we would have to wait for the ones that interest us to pass by.
Participant 4: Of course not! All information would be projected and you could choose.
The issue evoked then was how the think they could interact with the AR system.
Participant 3: With a remote control!
Moderator: And what would there be on this remote control?
Participant 3: Arrows
Participant 2: If not we could do like that (moving hands up and down, see Figure 6.10)
Moderator: You mean something like a movement detector?
Participant 2: Yes, exactly
Participant 1: It could be nice being able to use your body
Participant 4: Or maybe there could be something on the floor indicating where you have to move your body to go
(navigate) to on or the other place.

236

Figure 6.10: Participant demonstrating a possible way of gesture interaction with a mobile AR museum application

Talking about ways of interacting with the AR application, the issue of commanding the
application by voice was also introduced. Participants agreed that they would not really like that,
especially in the museum, and that that they already have enough of the automated voice menu
they use, sometimes without success, when using their mobile phones. Some of their words was
that “This is not evident”, or even “It is ridiculous”.
The next question introduced was what the participants would change if they made part of the
conceptualisation team. The dialogue that followed was very interesting:
Participant 2: Its playful side ! Personally I would place a mouth on the painting and it would be the painting
that would talk to me
Participant 3:

It is the persons on the painting that would talk

Participant 2:

And we see a mouth appearing on the paintings

Participant 5:

Yes but with the persons of the painting

Participant 6:

(laughing)

Participant 4: If not include games based on the paintings before or after but focused on the depicted subject
Participant 2: And a "paint” application so that we can virtually draw on the painting
Participant 4:

(laughing)
237

Moderator: Would you be interested in a function that would allow making notes?
Participant 2: Yes
Participant 4: How de we call this thing in the museum where anybody can write before walking away?
Moderator: You mean the visitors’ book where you could leave your comment… Would you be interested in
watching other peoples’ comments?
Participant 4: Yes!
Participant 3:

Something resembling the blogs principle, you see a picture that you like and you can make

comments or consult others’ comments if you want
Moderator: And what about taking pictures?
Participant 4:

It could be a nice souvenir of you with the painting!

The abundance of ideas regarding possible interactive characteristics of an AR guide, made a
participant question herself and the group whether the guide becoming too playful might be
related with issues, presented in section 5.2.1.

6.5.3.6 Remarks and conclusions resulting from the 2nd t Focus Group
Comparing with the 1st Focus Group, the discussions held among the 2nd Focus Group were more
balanced with the sense that no participant dominated the discussion. As this group of students
belongs to occasional museum visitors, it was also possible to discuss reasons for which people
might visit or not museums frequently. What was equally interesting, especially in conjunction
with the fears that have been expressed by the 1st Focus Group, regarding the fact that museum
interpretation material might guide more than necessary a visitor’s vision on a cultural heritage
object, was that for students of the 2nd group, interpretation material seems to be important for
their appreciation and understanding of a work of art. However, even among the 2nd group at least
two participants explicitly mentioned that interpretation material can indeed influence the way a

238

museum object might be perceived, while the notion of “discrimination” of commented objects
against not commented ones was also introduced.
Participants of the 2nd Focus Group were also more receptive regarding the use of the guide,
without this meaning that they were not critical as to issues such as the audio delivery, the
attentional balance, the media used etc. It is nevertheless significant to notice that even for issues
such as whether holding and using the mobile guide was tiring or not, opinions were also
juxtaposed.
Naturally, controversies were also observed when the discussion started turning around the AR
character of the guide. Again, despite the diversity of the opinions expressed the 2nd Focus Group
seemed to be more open than the 1st one. This might be also partly due to the fact that not only
there was more time available for the discussion, but also because the posters presenting other AR
applications were presented at the beginning and not at the end of the session. As a consequence,
during the 2nd Focus Group, various interaction ideas not only regarding the tested prototype but
also a future one were heard and discussed.

6.5.4 AN ADDITIONAL FOCUS GROUP EXERCISE

Shortly before the end of each session, a small “exercise” was proposed to students of both Focus
Groups. “Post-It” notes and pens were distributed and participants were invited to attribute must
and must-have-not characteristics of an ideal guide. This exercise built on the principle that
sometimes it is a common tendency for people to think of inanimate objects as having human-like
characteristics (Wasinger and Wahlster, 2006).
Some of the human-like characteristics attributed by the participants to an ideal guide were
“sensitive”, “original”, “curious”, “relaxed” and “subjective”. Other adjectives employed by the
participants were: “motivating”, “complementary” and “optional”, “educational”, “playful, “amusing” and
“surprising”, “different”, “interactive”, “discrete” and “practical”, but also “source of reflection”, to be
addressed to “as many people as possible”. At the same time the ideal guide should not be “obligatory”,
“selective”, “heavy in content” or “boring”.

239

6.6 SYNTHESIS OF THE MAIN FINDINGS AND RESULTS

6.6.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter presented the results yielded in all evaluation phases, regrouping them whenever that
was possible in distinct thematic units. In this last section an overall regrouping of the most
important detected issues is attempted, in order to provide an even more intelligible apprehension
of the evaluation outcomes.

6.6.2 USING AR FOR GEOLOCALIZATION AND NAVIGATION

Before presenting our findings as to the main research hypothesis related with the use of AR as a
mean for geolocalization and navigation in an interactive mobile museum guide, it would be useful
to resume the main ways the AR metaphor was employed in the design and implementation of the
proposed prototype.

240

A)

Geolocalization and Painting Identification: The visitor, holding the guide, “scans” the

surrounding environment, so as to discover the commented paintings. When a painting has been
detected, a visual alert, in the form of a question mark, informs that a commented painting has
been found.
B)

Navigation in Subthemes: When the visitor approaches the commented painting and views

it through the screen of the UMPC, oval virtual overlays, each representing a specific subtheme,
appear arranged around the painting.
C)

Selecting among different types of available media: Each time one of the five subthemes is

activated, new virtual overlays each representing a different type of medium (text, audio, movie,
2D or 3D slideshow), plus a return button, appear arranged around the screen (Chapter 4, Figure
4.15).
D)

Navigation and manipulation of the multimedia presentations: According to the type of

the activated medium, the content might either cover the totality of the display or complement registered in 3D- the examined painting. For example, a depicted person or a detail might “jump
out” of the painting. When a multimedia sequence is launched, the visitor can navigate forwards
and backwards using the joystick of the UMPC (Chapter 4, Figure 4.15).
E)

In addition, a “freeze” touch sensitive button was provided. This was proposed so that the

visitors navigate in the content without having to continuously film with the attached webcam the
commented paintings.
In order to accomplish the above tasks and proceed with the guided tour, the participants had to:
A)

Understand the “scanning” metaphor and, additionally, realize through practice, that

the paintings had to be “scanned” not partially but in their totality so as to be recognized by the
system.
B)

Understand the proposed navigation scheme and, using the joystick, move and/or

activate one subtheme after the other.
C)

Understand that each of the selected pictograms appearing under each subtheme

represents a different medium.
241

D)

Understand that when sequenced 2D or 3D multimedia material was activated, the

UMPC joystick could be used to go forward or backwards.
E)

Understand the role and function of the “freeze” button.

With the exception of the fourth step, the first three steps consistently built on the AR metaphor
both for navigation in the museum space (identification of the commented paintings, scattered
among a majority of non-commented paintings) and for navigation in the multimedia
interpretation material of the interactive application. Having decorticated the AR inspired
metaphors used for the interaction with the proposed prototype, we can now proceed in
examining more carefully each of them.
A)

Observation demonstrated that the “scanning” of the paintings in order to discover the

commented ones was an easy and intuitive task for the majority of the participants (section 6.2.2).
Only in a few cases the subjects faced difficulties, but eventually all 12 participants understood the
metaphor. Stressed and less confident visitors were more error prone regarding this issue. The
results of the survey are conformant with the issues detected during the observations; the
statement “Identifying the commented works was easy” achieved one of the best scores (3.4/4)
with all students choosing either the “mostly agree” or “somewhat agree” option. The relevant
data provided by the semi-structured interviews and the Focus Groups is also coherent with this
picture. In addition, the fact that the identification issue did not arise as a main discussion topic
neither during the interviews nor during the Focus Group session also provides a proof that this
task was comprehensible by most participants.
B)

The quantitative and qualitative results also demonstrate that the navigation using the

proposed subthemes was equally well understood. During the observations three schemes of
navigation were detected: i) random navigation from one theme to the other, ii) consistent use of
the proposed order for navigation in a linear way and iii) consistent but not linear activation of the
proposed subthemes. The findings from the semi-structured interviews in which the issue was
brought up were also consistent with the observations, as well as the survey results; all students
either strongly or somewhat agreed with the “easiness of navigation” statement that achieved a
score of 3.25/4. A supplementary element as to whether the navigation scheme proposed was
intuitive or not, is that during the Focus Group sessions that were conducted approximately six

242

weeks after the visit, many participants were able to describe in detail the way the navigated in the
application proving retention of the navigation scheme over time.
C)

The same holds true for the association of each pictogram with a particular medium. The

only relevant comment as to this point was that some pictograms –for example the pictogram
selected for the slideshows- were less self-explanatory than some others (audio, video, text). The
Students of Fine Arts also commented that the graphic design, in particular the 3D ovals and the
selected pictograms, could have been less basic and more “artistic” (Semi-structured interviews
and Focus Group 1).
D)

A problem appeared with the forward/backward navigation in some of the multimedia

sequences, manipulated using the UMPC joystick, because no visual cue was given. Nevertheless
the majority of the participants intuitively used the joystick without being instructed to
(observations). Finally, regarding the available controls, many participants pointed out that in
addition to the “return” (escape) button, they would like to have a pause, back and forward button
for the audio.
E)

Another graphical user interface related problem was the touch sensitive “freeze” button

that, as mentioned in section 6.2.2 provoked two types of incidents. The first was that some
participants thought, by generalization, principally at the beginning of the tour, that other virtual
overlays (e.g. the subthemes), are also touch-sensitive. The second was that the role of the button
was misunderstood by some participants who tried several times to use it not as a “pause” but as a
“freeze” button.
From the above, we can induce that the proposed navigation scheme was quite well accepted. In
this sense, we can consider that the performance of the AR based navigation and interaction
scheme was successful. But, as we will see further on, that does not necessarily come with a
hypothetical wide acceptance of AR technologies in the museum environment.
6.6.3 AFFECTIVE REACTIONS REGARDING AR

In section 6.3 the results of the survey were presented in detail. The “usability” part of the survey
was of special interest regarding the AR character of the mobile museum guide application. As we
saw above, the results concerning the identification of the commented works in the museum
galleries and the navigation in the guide’s content were quite encouraging. However, when a bit
later on, participants were asked whether “The real objects augmented with the virtual ones
243

facilitated the access in the content” opinions were considerably scattered. The answers were
equally divided between the “Mostly Agree”, “Somewhat Agree” and “Somewhat Disagree”
options.
This can be considered as a paradox, especially if this evidence is compared with the results
obtained for the statements “Identifying the commented works was easy” (score 3.4) and
“Navigation in the content of the guide was easy” (score 3.25), because both identification and
navigation were based on the use of virtual overlays augmenting the viewed, real, scene. Besides
the fact that this issue provides a good example of the importance in the formulation of the
research questions, how could this inconsistency be explained?
Focus Groups provided interesting insights as to this matter. During both Focus Groups
comparable reactions were noted when the issue of AR technologies and applications emerged.
The posters prepared for the Focus Group sessions (Appendix 7) provoked vivid reactions from
participants of both groups, but not less than the term “Augmented Reality” itself. For example a
female student (2nd Focus Group) admitted that she wants to see her own reality, and does not
want it to be augmented (section 6.5.3.5). The same attitude was conveyed by the sayings of a male
student (1st Focus Group) who said that his vision would be “already constructed” and that if he goes
to a museum it is not to “see something through glasses”. A 3rd participant also reacted (1st Focus
Group) by saying that “The people who will start using these things, will not be able to do without them, they
will not have the mood to go and search for things themselves.” Finally, a male participant compared a
hypothetical intrusion of AR displays with the intrusion of cell phones in our everyday lives,
precising that if visitors get used to this comfort “the day they will not have that they will be lost…”.

6.6.4 SUGGESTED POSSIBLE AR INTERACTION IDEAS

Despite these reactions provoked to both Focus Groups, it seems that for the 2nd Focus Group
(occasional museum visitors) it was easier to turn the initial discomfort and disagreements
regarding AR technologies into feedback as to possible ways AR could be used in the examined
content. According to a male participant it would be interesting to try in order to see “if everything
happens on the painting” or if we have the “impression of being in front of a computer screen”.
As to the ways interaction could be achieved with a fixed or mobile AR display, participants of the
2nd Focus Group discussed several possibilities such as voice, gesture or movement command of
the application. An interesting AR scenario was also exposed, consisting of animating the
personalities depicted on paintings, thus “allowing” them to narrate their story in the 1st person.
244

6.6.5 AR APPLICATION DEVICE AND DELIVERY

The creation and evaluation of the prototype tested was marked by several constraints. For the
users of the AR application, the most important was the lack of an appropriate terminal in terms
of size, weight and adapted application controls. Additionally, the participants had to carry on
them the ARCHOS multimedia player for the recording of their sessions, wear a small head
camera attached to a strap around the head and cope not only with the observer and the other
members of the research team, but also with other museum visitors that happened to be present
during the experimentation sessions.
Therefore, it comes as no surprise that some of the usability issues identified by the participants
themselves are related with the above mentioned experimental conditions. Several participants
mentioned the weight of the prototype and the fact that it was not “handy” enough; a student
wished that there was at least a “place to put the guide”, while one participant noted that he had
difficulties activating with his fingertip the touch sensitive “pause” button, as the guide had to be
hold by both hands.
Another issue, detected multiple times during the observations, the semi-structured interviews, the
survey and the Focus Groups was the delivery of the audio. The UMPC speakers performed well
when the environment was quiet, but in cases of strong visitor affluence, participants faced
difficulties in hearing the commentaries.
Observation revealed that the role of the “freeze” button was not clear enough. Some users tried
to use it unsuccessfully in order to “freeze” the audio and some of the multimedia presentations
while others, by generalization, were brought to believe that other graphic elements on the screen,
like the pictograms used to represent the available media, were also touch-sensitive.
In contrast with the above problems that were detected principally by means of observation and
were not commented by the participants themselves, the need for a “pause”, “rewind” or
“forward” button in the audio sequences and in certain multimedia presentations was clearly and
explicitly mentioned by many participants, in more than one of the evaluation phases.

6.6.6 SUBJECTIVE VISITOR SATISFACTION

Despite the circumscription of the equipment configuration, the large majority of the participants
decided to go through the full content of the application, though the instructions they had been
245

given encouraged them to consult only the content that most appeals to them. Moreover, some of
the visitors, when prompted to accelerate the visit, demonstrated signs of a certain frustration.
The identification of the commented paintings in the museum galleries was an easy task for all
participants, especially after the detection of the 1st painting while navigation in the content of the
application by manipulation of the virtual overlays representing the themes, proved to be
straightforward and intuitive. Testimonials are given not only by the quantitative analysis (survey)
but also from the qualitative, as participants referred often to their favorite or less favorite themes,
even during the Focus Groups, approximately six weeks after their visit.
Browsing the content of the application was not performed mechanically. A single non
synchronization of image and sound was perceived and commented by most participants while a
single case where the content of a text and an audio commentary was the same was mentioned
more than once during the interviews. Generally speaking, the large majority of participants
seemed to be rather invested in the AR visit.
The results of the survey answers that demanded from participants to self-assess their visiting
experience are also informative. All participants, with the exception of one, had a strong or
moderately positive attitude as to whether the guide helped them to better approach the paintings.
Good results were also obtained when they were asked whether they think they learned more in
comparison with a conventional museum visit, as a consequence of using the guide (3.08).
However, it is important to notice at this point the correlation among some of the results obtained
in the survey with the two different visitors’ profiles that participated in the study. The score
obtained by occasional museum visitors regarding whether the visiting experience was better as a
consequence of using the guide was much higher (3.5/4) compared with the score obtained by the
frequent museum visitors (2.33/4). The same scores were also obtained by the question asking
participants to self-assess whether they think having learned more because of using the guide.
Also, the question regarding the comprehension and appreciation of the commented works of art
achieved a 3.33/4 score among the occasional museum goers, against a 2.83/4 score among the
frequent museum goers group. When all scores from all questions were added up to find the mean
for each participant separately and then for each group, the same tendency was observed. Among
the occasional museum goers, the lowest score observed was 3 and the highest 3.64 (mean 3.3)
while among the frequent museum goers the lowest score was 2.85/4 and the highest 3.28/4
(mean 2.96).
246

A very high score (3.5/4) was obtained regarding the playfulness of the tested guide as all
participants chose the “Mostly Agree” or “Somewhat Agree” statement. The mean was the same
for both groups that participated in the study. In addition, the word “playful” appeared as an
answer in open-ended questions of the survey no less than 6 times. The topic was also evoked
during both Focus Group sessions. However, a particular point demands further attention. The
word was not used in a positive way at all times. That does not mean that the participants
considered that the word has a negative connotation. A closer look at the discussions held during
the Focus Group, shows that in the experimentations conducted in the museum of Fine Arts in
Rennes, participants seemed to worry regarding the degree to which this “ingredient” could be
present in a mobile museum guide application. This remark brings us to the “attentional balance”
issue, which is further examined in the next session.

6.6.7 ATTENTIONAL BALANCE, USER DISTRACTION AND COGNITIVE OVERLOAD

In which way the admittedly playful character of the guide could be related with the issue of
attentional balance (else the division and constant switch of focus, concentration and attention
from the actual painting to the mobile museum guide and vice versa)? The participants’ comments
and the feedback of the participants were very enlightening as to this issue.
Using a student’s words, “It is true, (the guide) demands concentration and maybe not all kind of public could
stay at the guide (the content) all the time”. Another participant said that this happens because, especially
at the beginning of the tour, “we don’t know, we click a bit everywhere, on all themes, but not everything
interests us”. “We juggle a bit between the two (the painting and the application)”, another participant said,
“but then again that is what the application proposes” while sometimes “… (the fact of) having the device on
hands makes as watch it”. “The guide distracts from the painting itself”, and this is probably one of the
reasons for which one of the answers given in the must-have-not characteristics of the guide, was
that “it should not make us observe only the screen”.
A special concern was exhibited concerning a possible use of the guide by children in three of the
four evaluation phases (interviews, survey, focus groups). The participants who made this remark
suggested that children might have the tendency to get absorbed by the guide and use it as a game
with a repercussion on their discovery of the real exhibition space. As suggested two times, one in
each focus group session, if it is to watch the paintings on the screen we could as well stay home
“visiting virtually the museum”. It is maybe for these reasons that a female participant suggested
247

answering in one of the survey questions, that the guide should not be used by children who are
less than 15 years old (“… I would not put this kind of thing in between children’s hands…There were special
guides for that in the museum who manage to create a dialogue with the children…I would not want to imagine all
these children with their little headset and their little device…” (P6)). A participant of the 1st FG reported
on the same issue that he believes that “kids could be manipulated,…If we impose to kids to understand and
perceive the world of art like that…” (P1). Though it is not completely rational to make guesses as to
the effect a mobile multimedia AR guide could have on children, it is true that often enough
children of young age that happened to be present during the experimentations manifested a vivid
interest for the experimentations and especially for the guide.
The attentional balance issue is also linked with a possible cognitive overload provoked by the
amount of information available in the guide. In a survey comment, a student wrote “I wonder if
there is no too much information so suddenly we want to see everything but there is too much and then we hear only a
few things...”). Somebody else talked about an “abundance of information, at the same time that we watch the
painting.”
Taking under consideration these comments it becomes maybe more unambiguous, why despite
the fact that 11 out of the 12 participants expressed themselves positively as to whether using the
guide was helpful towards approaching the paintings and 9 out of 12 believe they learned more,
only 4 stated when asked that they did not feel distracted by the guide. It is however important to
notice that the mean obtained among the occasional museum goers regarding the negatively
expressed statement “I find that using the guide distracted me from the real work of art” was
considerable lower in comparison with the frequent museum goers (2 against 3.5/4).

6.6.8 PERSONALIZATION/CUSTOMIZATION

Customization and personalisation of services and devices is an important issue related with
human computer interaction with a (presumable) decisive effect in the overall user experience. As
already demonstrated in section 2.2.4, this issue has already drawn the attention of the scientific
community of Cultural Heritage Informatics. An additional reason for that is that museums are by
definition open to the society and deliver messages to diverse publics in terms of age, interests,
and needs. Therefore it comes as no surprise that many aspects concerning the personalization
and adaptation of museum related information technologies have been treated on several
occasions, including the mobile multimedia museum guides’ context of use. For these reasons, the
experimentations in the museum of Fine Arts in Rennes did not intend to examine thoroughly the
248

interrelations between visitor profiles and acceptance of the AR enabled mobile guide. However,
in the course of the evaluation process rich and informative evidence appeared that sheds light on
the ways different museum visitor- profiles, interests, preferences, wishes and needs could
influence and inform the conceptualisation and design of a mobile multimedia museum guide.
Should mobile museum guides cater for the needs of visitors visiting with family or friends?
Should a multimedia guide provide also textual information? What about audio comments and
which should be their duration? Would visitors rather prefer a single audio headset to a normal
one? And what about linking the museum visiting phase with the post-visit experience? Several of
the issues that came to light during the evaluation phase had not always been foreseen.
According to the answers of the participants museum visiting might not always occur as a social
activity. While some of the participants enjoy visiting museum with companions, discussing and
exchanging ideas with them, some students clearly expressed that they either prefer visiting
museums alone or accompanied by a companion who shares the same background.
Interpretation is not consistently used. Apart the (not so) obvious regretted absence of
interpretation material, especially regarding contemporary art (as cited by participants themselves),
other reasons that were identified were:
a.

the fear that interpretation material might be selective, including some works and

excluding others,
b.

the fear that the provided interpretation material might impose the a-priori of other

persons
c.

the fear that a suggested tour might be “too guided”

d.

the fear that the interpretation material might reveal information that will dissolve the

very personal feeling an exposed object might provoke to a visitor
However, even the more reactive against the use of whatsoever interpretation material students,
admitted that for a public not possessing specialized knowledge on history of art, a kind of aid
might be indeed needed. The need but also the wish of a non-specialised museum visitor to better
approach and comprehend a tacit work of art became more than apparent during the 2nd Focus
Group. Statements like “We often hesitate to go (to a museum) because we are not adequately informed and once
in front of a work we feel a bit limited” or even “we do not feel at our place” express the frustration a visitor
might experience in the effort to “read” and then “interpret” a museum object.
249

Another interesting conclusion is that not all interpretation media have the same effect on visitors.
The students of both groups held long arguments as to the pros and the cons of text, audio,
guided visits or multimedia kiosks. While a student of the 2nd group negatively commented that
she did not expect to find text in a multimedia guide, another student said that comparing with
paper-printed text, she enjoyed reading using the guide. The same participant admitted that she
never uses audio guides and that for this reason she was not interested by the audio sequences of
the multimedia guide. However, a bit later, one of her colleagues mentioned that though she
usually reads texts and does not use audio, she found very interesting and useful the inclusion of
different media in the guide and enjoyed for a first time hearing an audio comment while watching
a painting.
The use of text in the mobile guide deserves a specific mention. The results of the survey show
that text comes on top as to the frequency of use in comparison with other media during a
“conventional” museum visit. However, comparing with the answers as to the use of the available
in the multimedia guide media, the text retains more or less the same percentage, despite the fact
that the use of the audio and the multimedia climbs from 8.3% and 16.7% to 66.7% respectively.
Some good reasons for that were provided during the Focus Groups. Comparing the audio with
the text, one participant said that she feels it is easier to concentrate when reading a text, because
if something is not understood at first, it can be reread. This finding is quite important, as during
the design of the prototype a doubt had been installed as to whether simple textual information
should be included in the guide.
Long dialogues were also held as to the kind of information the interpretation mean should
provide, in terms of content. According to one participant the guide should “set the good questions”.
According to another student a mobile guide should help on some aspects but leave free the
visitor to trust his senses on others. In terms of content, while one participant explicitly
mentioned that he would like to have something regarding the painting description, another
participant of the same group implied that she does not need a description if she is watching a
painting in real. So even in between the same group, positions, feelings and ideas about what the
guide should include and how it should be presented were quite different.
This last remark was also validated by the fact that different content had different effects on
subjects. More importantly, very often participants expressed themselves regarding favourite,
interesting or less interesting themes included in all four paintings, while some participants seemed
to navigate through the content following the same order in the activation of the themes (e.g. first
choosing “artist”, then “technique” etc).
250

Many other occasions revealed a diversity of opinions. For example, most of the audio sequences
exceeded the 1.30” minute rule usually employed in museum audio guides. However, when visitors
were asked their opinion as to the audio duration, only half of them found the audio content to be
too long. Another personalization-related example related once again with the audio concerns the
preference over a single or double headset. While most participants explicitly mentioned that they
‘d prefer the latter, a female participant mentioned that she’d prefer a single headset as she is
stressed whenever she is not in auditory contact with her surrounding environment. This
justification is reasonable enough to be overseen, even if expressed by only one participant.
Apart from this manifested diversity of likes, dislikes and opinions regarding the prototype tested
but also mobile multimedia guides in general, participants themselves also identified specific
visitor groups for which specific attributes should be absent or present. A student for example,
said that a guide destined to children should have a different approach than one for adults while
another student underlined the importance of providing the guide content in several languages. As
to the Fine Arts students group, a participant specified that as they already have foundations in
approaching museum objects, they should be able to access a maximum of information in a
minimum of time. Finally and also related with the issue of personalization or catering for the
needs of specific visitor profiles, it should be noted that at least two participants answered they
would use such a guide depending on the exhibition or the nature of paintings/objects included.
Finally, as we also saw in section 6.6.6, the most illustrative example as to the need for
personalization is provided by our particular case study. Though qualitative and limited in sample,
it became clear more than once, that the two different visitors’ profiles examined demonstrated a
different attitude and acceptance regarding the utility and the usability of the mobile AR guide in
the context of a museum visit.

6.6.9 PROPOSED AMELIORATIONS ON THE TESTED AR PROTOTYPE

Some easy to implement ameliorations resulting from the feedback received during the evaluation
sessions concern the modalities of the configuration delivery for the AR application. Alternative
mobile platforms could equally be tested, as for example the SONY Vaio UX series presented in
section 4.2.2. Meanwhile, the Orange Labs in Rennes have already received a new version of a
SAMSUNG Origami Q1 which is lighter, has an integrated webcam and will be probably used in
future experimentations. A neck strap could be attached so that future users do not fear an
accident. It is also worth noticing that the use of the ARCHOS multimedia player with the
attached head camera and microphone for the recording of the sessions caused also quite probably
251

a discomfort to some of the participants that might have an impact on the proposed mobile AR
experience.
A different issue that was detected on several occasions -though not foreseen- was related with the
audio delivery. As we saw in section 5.4.4 because of the additional ARCHOS equipment carried
by the participants but also in order to facilitate the observation, all audio sequences were
delivered through the integrated UMPC speakers. During the observations it became clear that in
periods of great visitor affluence in the museum galleries, participants had difficulties in listening
the audio commentaries. Though the protocol and the research questions had not foreseen this
issue, participants discomfort found its way through us, as the problem was mentioned
spontaneously not only during the semi-structured interviews and the focus groups but also in
open-ended questions of the survey. It is therefore clear that the audio should be delivered using
headphones not only because of the poor performance of the integrated UMPC speakers but also
as a courtesy to other museum visitors. Another issue related with the audio delivery, as pointed
out by several participants, was the absence of a pause, forward and backwards button for the
audio sequences.
In terms of interface a first necessary change is related with the touch-sensitive “freeze” button
(“pause” in French). Its role was misunderstood several times (see section 6.2.2). An additional
problem was highlighted by a male participant who said that as the UMPC has to be hold with
both hands, it is quite difficult to disengage one hand so as to activate with the fingertip the
“freeze” button. Some possible solutions regarding these problems could be to label the button
with a more appropriate name, to render it larger so that as to enable an easier activation, or to use
another device button in order to activate this function.

6.6.10 USERS PROPOSALS REGARDING NEW FUNCTIONS

Finally it could be interesting to resume in brief some functions that in their majority were first
seen in Chapter 2 (section 2.2) but acquire here a particular interest as they were proposed as
future add-ons by the students that participated in the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes
experimentations.
The first one, proposed by two different students in the two Focus Group sessions, is a “paint-it”
application or -using the students of Fine Arts words- provide the possibility to “transform the
painting on the screen, like changing the colors”, but also be then able “…to print that and take it home to
have a small souvenir of what we did”.
252

Animating a painting’s personalities and make them narrate their story was another idea that was
proposed by a Social Sciences student. The way that was described was quite theatrical, with a
female participant precising how she would animate the mouth of the depicted person and
another one proposing to animate the full personality. Games regarding the paintings, especially
adapted for children were also proposed during the 2nd Focus Group.
Other ideas that were discussed were the possibility to take personal notes regarding the painting,
using the AR device, the creation of a virtual visitors’ book where everyone could see the
comments other visitors left regarding a painting and a photo-souvenir function, that would then
transfer to the visitor’s email address the captured pictures.

6.6.11 APPLICATION ACCEPTANCE AND POTENTIAL USER ADOPTION

Apart the variety of the issues discussed above, there also exists a category of factors that could
difficultly fit in any of the above discussed sections.
For example the survey and the Focus Group provided evidence demonstrating that a high rental
fee might be prohibiting for young people that might be positively predisposed for using the
guide. Another reported dissuasive factor was visiting a museum together with a companion. For
other students the choice would also be subject to the content of both the museum exhibition and
the guide.
Lastly, the “must” and “must-have-not” attributes associated by participants to the ideal mobile
museum guide during the focus group sessions are also quite informative. An ideal mobile
museum companion should not be “obligatory”, “selective”, “heavy in content” or “boring”. To gain wide
acceptance, it’d better be “motivating” but also “relaxed”, “educational” and “complementary”, “playful”,
“surprising” and “amusing”, “different” or “original”, “curious”, and “interactive”, “practical” and “discrete”,
“subjective”, but also “source of reflection”, and accessible “to as many people as possible”.

253

CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
7.1 SUMMARY

This thesis addressed the issue of introduction of mobile multimedia guides in the museum setting
and suggested that the use of mobile AR technologies and the AR metaphor, as a principal
component for the conceptual and interaction design of mobile museum guide applications, could
greatly facilitate interaction and navigation both in a mobile multimedia application and in the
sensitive museum environment.
Several steps were necessary before addressing the main research hypothesis through the design
and evaluation of a mobile AR multimedia museum guide. An exhaustive state of the art for
mobile museum guides was provided as well as a set of classification criteria with the goal to assist
in establishing taxonomies but also in the presentation of the main functional requirements and
the identification of principal issues mobile museum guide projects seek to address. The main
human, economical and technological challenges and barriers to overcome were also highlighted
in order to comprehend the reasons that have been so far preventing the generalization of use of
mobile multimedia museum guides.
According to our main research hypothesis, the use and introduction of mobile Augmented
Reality (AR) technologies and the AR metaphor, might provide a new, interesting alternative for
assisting the visitor in the tasks of geolocalization and orientation both in the physical (the
museum) and the digital (the mobile application) environment. This hypothesis was backed up
both by the examination of current geolocalization methods as well as by a thorough analysis of
the complex issue of interaction with mobile devices in the museum environment. As the visitor’s
attention gets fuzzily allocated among the museum guide and the surrounding environment (the
museum object and other co-visitors), we suggested that, by “augmenting” the real, surrounding
environment we assist the visitor in establishing clear, intuitive and straightforward links between
the signifier (the digital multimedia application) and the signified (the museum objects on display).
254

In order to test this hypothesis, a mobile AR multimedia guide was designed, implemented and
evaluated, using a user-centered approach, with the active participation of the state contemporary
museum of Fine Arts, in Rennes, Brittany, France. After the creation and presentation of a first
AR mobile museum guide prototype and the population of a comprehensive, potential functions
list, a second AR prototype was designed and implemented in order to be tested in a real museum
environment. A formal, extensive and qualitative in nature evaluation protocol was employed,
shaped by several methodological considerations. The experimentations, consisting of direct and
indirect observations, semi-structured interviews, the use of a survey and two focus group
sessions, proved that AR has indeed the potential to be used as an intuitive and easy to understand
alternative for geolocalization and orientation in the museum space and the mobile multimedia
application, even by non-experienced IT users.
This chapter sums up the main conclusions resulting from the undertaken experimentations and
other substantial methodological and theoretical contributions related both with the issue of
mobile multimedia applications for the museum environment and the mobile AR character of the
proposed application.

7.2 CONTRIBUTIONS

7.2.1 INTEGRATING AR IN MOBILE MULTIMEDIA MUSEUM GUIDES

Research problem: One of the most daunting tasks for a visitor during a museum visit is the
correlation of the museum object contemplated with the relevant information provided by the
selected interpretation medium, regardless of its nature (paper book, audio guide, multimedia
kiosk, mobile museum guide). Especially regarding mobile multimedia museum guides, the issue
of location awareness has proved to be of capital importance, as the visitors need to know not
only how to “locate” themselves by navigating in the exhibition’s physical space but also in the
interactive application, as both actions occur at the same time. Therefore, two important questions
museum visitors may pose themselves when using mobile multimedia museum guides are: a.
Where can I find the object for which I can see there is relevant content? b. Where / how can I
find information for this particular exhibition object I just happened to see? Both of these
substantial questions share a common characteristic: they demand from the visitor to navigate
from the digital to the physical space and vice versa (Damala et al., 2008).
Proposed approach: After examining the advantages and disadvantages of already existing
geolocalization methods used in mobile museum guide projects, we argued that the use of a still
255

emerging technology, AR, and the metaphor it introduces might worth to be considered as an
interesting alternative for navigation and orientation both in the museum space as well as in the
interactive multimedia content of the mobile museum guide. AR applications promise to extend
the interaction in the real world surrounding us, by blending the real and the virtual and more
particularly by overlaying computer generated graphics onto the perceived surrounding
environment.
Evaluation: AR has already been used for cultural heritage related applications but has been
scarcely proposed as an alternative method for geolocalization and orientation in mobile museum
guide applications. Therefore, the first crucial test was to examine the ways AR could be integrated
in mobile museum guides, through the population of a comprehensive function list, and then talk
museum professionals into the interests of setting up a common project for evaluation in a real
museum environment. The implementation of a first, working, AR prototype proved to be of
great help, as it assisted in demonstrating the principle of mobile AR and the use it can have when
integrated in a mobile multimedia museum guide.

7.2.2 USING AR FOR NAVIGATION AND ORIENTATION IN THE MUSEUM SPACE

Research problem: The first and most important principle a museum visitor needs to understand
while using a mobile multimedia museum guide or any other interpretation material is how to
correlate the signifier, the interpretation material provided by the mobile museum guide
application, with the signified, i.e., the commented museum object on display. This task is further
complicated by the fact that the user of the application, in our case the museum visitor, does not
solely interact with a mobile multimedia application, but also with the surrounding museum
environment as well as with other visiting companions in a fuzzy manner. The research question
in this case is whether the use and integration of mobile AR in mobile multimedia guides can
provide an alternative way for an easy and intuitive identification of the commented objects as well
as a potential alternative for geolocalization and orientation. This way, instead of searching a point
of reference on a digital, physically non-related with the environment, space, the museum visitor
uses the real museum environment as a point of reference.
Proposed solution: Working closely with the museum representatives, a new mobile AR
prototype, featuring 4 paintings, was designed and implemented before being evaluated in a real
museum environment. The visitor uses a camera-equipped UMPC in order to “scan” the
surrounding environment and detect, among many other non-commented paintings, the ones
included in the multimedia tour.
256

Evaluation: The guide was tested by a test group consisting of 12 students, aged between 18 and
23 years old, using direct and indirect observations, semi-structured interviews, a survey, and two
focus group sessions. The relevant findings of all evaluation phases proved that the task of
localization and identification of the commented works in the museum galleries using the AR
metaphor was straightforward, easy and intuitive for the large majority of participants. The only
difficulty encountered by the participants, though only at the beginning of the tour, was to
understand that in order to make the virtual overlays to appear, the paintings had to be visible by
the camera in their full height and length.
7.2.3 USING AR FOR NAVIGATION IN THE CONTENT OF THE APPLICATION

Question: Apart from using AR for the identification of the included in the mobile museum
guide paintings, the AR metaphor was also consistently used for navigation in the interactive
content of the application. The question in this case was whether the navigation scheme, also
based on the AR metaphor, was easy and intuitive to understand.
Proposed solution: The navigation in the mobile museum guide application was consistently
built on the AR metaphor. When a painting is located, a visual and audio alert is produced to
indicate that a painting has been found, while when the visitor approaches closer a new interactive
menu appears on the display of the UMPC screen around the identified painting, composed from
virtual overlays, each representing a particular theme. When a theme is activated, new virtual
overlays in the form of pictograms (representing data in form of text, audio, slideshow or video)
are arranged around the commented painting.
Evaluation: The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated that the navigation scheme was
very well understood. The findings from the semi-structured interviews in which the issue was
brought up were in accordance with the findings of the observations, and the survey results; all
students either strongly or somewhat agreed with the “easiness of navigation” statement.
Additionally, during the Focus Group sessions, many participants were capable of describing in
detail the way they navigated in the application proving retention of the navigation scheme over
time.

7.2.4 THE NEED FOR PERSONALIZATION AND CUSTOMIZATION OF APPLICATIONS AND
SERVICES

Question: Personalization and customization is a much discussed concern regarding mobile
devices and services which acquires an even greater importance in the museum environment, by
257

definition open to a public of different ages and backgrounds. While personalization has been
studied in many instances in relation to museum web sites, personalization concerning mobile
museum guides is still far from being adequately explored. Though the experimentation in the
Museum of Fine Arts had not explicitly set as a primary goal examining the need for
personalization, the evidence that came to light proved to be very informative as to this issue.
Proposed Answer: Apart the diversity of answers obtained by the participants as to their visiting
habits, the use of interpretation material and the frequency of visit, the content of the mobile
guide and the media used did not have the same effect on all participants. An illustrative example
is that though almost all participants had a strong or moderately positive attitude as to whether the
guide helped them better approach the paintings and admitted that they would use it if available in
a museum, the group of occasional museum visitors seemed to appreciate more using the guide
and felt more confident as to whether they learned more in comparison with the group of
frequent museum visitors. Many other occasions revealed a diversity of likes and dislikes (for
example, though many of the audio sequences exceeded the 1.30” average audio comment
duration, only half of the participants found them to be too long), demonstrating that the new
possibilities opening up regarding the personalization of content and services respond to an actual
need.

7.2.5 PUTTING THE EXPERIMENTATION METHODOLOGY ON THE BENCHMARK

Research Question: Given the scarcity of mobile AR evaluation and user-centered studies and
the absence of any study regarding the integration of mobile AR technologies for mobile guides in
the museum setting, a research issue that emerged was not only to come to some conclusions as to
the suitability of the experimentation methodology and the adopted experimentation protocol but
also to backup and demonstrate the need for user-centered design and evaluation of mobile AR
applications.
Answer: Due to the lack of evidence from relevant experimentations, our evaluation protocol
favored an exploratory in nature study, mainly qualitative in nature. The combination of four
different evaluation methods (observations, semi-structured interviews, survey, and focus groups)
was proved to be more than well suited for the research carried out, as it allowed not only the
triangulation of the results, but also the detection of issues that would have otherwise remained
undetected (for example, the problem caused by the “freeze” button and the problems related
with the audio delivery).

258

Another remark of particular interest was that the interactive multimedia content that benefited
most from the interdisciplinary collaboration with museum professionals came on the top of the
test group preferences, thus validating our approach of working, from the very beginning, closely
with all of the involved stakeholders. Other findings also established the significance of
implicating potential users earlier in the design process: the experimentation participants
demonstrated ability in captivating the essence of the experimentations and the AR approach,
offered useful input for future functions to be embedded and managed to express themselves as
to potential ways of interacting with more advanced and innovative AR applications. Finally it
should be noted that these findings were detected using a relatively small test group consisting of
12 students, proving thus that even small scale user-centered design and evaluation can provide
very useful insights.

7.3 A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE AR APPROACH

Employing a cutting edge technology, largely still under development, for the implementation of a
mobile multimedia application does not come without a certain cost. And even though the
research hypothesis as to whether AR can provide an interesting alternative as an interaction
component for mobile multimedia museum guides was confirmed, it would be an omission not to
look further into some important issues that raised our concerns, during the full life circle of the
proposed intervention.
As already discussed in Chapter 3, AR applications rely heavily on accurate, fast and robust
tracking mechanisms. Especially for mobile AR applications this need is even more imposing, as
the context of use of the application cannot always be controlled. Despite the fact that the indoor
museum space can be qualified as much more easy to control in comparison with other indoor or
outdoor environments, at the time of the experimentations, the algorithms developed were not
robust enough so as to detect all museum paintings. As a consequence, museum curators were
extremely restrained regarding the content selection and were obliged to choose among a
preselected test group of easily and robustly recognized by the system paintings.
Another important difficulty was that, as AR applications are still far for creating a mass market
success, potential users, in our case the museum representatives, are rarely aware of the modalities
of the technology and find very difficult expressing their needs in terms of AR scenarios as well as
anticipating ways with which AR applications could be used in their setting. This was also an

259

additional reason for which the interdisciplinary collaboration necessitated for mobile museum
guide projects was even more intensive in the case of the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes project.
The very same reason also created difficulties in the evaluation phase. Mobile AR had to be put on
the benchmark, as an alternative solution for geolocalization, orientation and navigation. However
from the very beginning, it was clear that this question was not possible to be answered in an
absolute manner; neither the museum nor the test group had any experience regarding AR
applications, or mobile multimedia guides used as an interpretation resource in the museum
setting. This consideration had a clear impact on the evaluation methodology and the evaluation
protocol finally adopted for the experimentations.
Finally, the most important constraint is related with the nature, the potential and the aspirations
of mobile AR technologies, promising to embed interaction right where it belongs, in the real
environment surrounding us, freeing us from the conventional interaction with WIMP (Windows,
Icons, Menu, Pointing devices) interfaces. However the current state of the art in Mobile AR
applications is still quite far from this perspective. Looking closer to our case study, we were
lacking the possibility to provide our test group with a platform-free AR experience, proposing for
example a lighter, more discrete, more futuristic display so as to completely liberate museum
visitors from a quite heavy and impossible to manage without using both hands, equipment.
7.4 FUTURE WORK WITHIN A SHORT-TERM HORIZON

The work carried out during this thesis formed part of a proposal directed to the French National
Research Agency in the 2007 selection, regarding the creation of a mobile augmented reality guide
for the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes. The project proposal was successful, so we can consider
that from January 2008 and for 30 months (until mid 2010) our case study entered a new phase of
development and experimentations.
The new guide, largely based on the prototype we examined and evaluated, will target young
people between 15-25 years old and will be first available on a UMPC platform, while at a second
phase it will be also proposed on smart phones. New and more robust algorithms will be
developed and integrated while the vision based tracking and pose estimation method used for the
examined by the thesis prototype will be also enriched through the use of specific sensors (e.g.
magnetometer, accelerometer). In terms of content, the new prototype will also integrate animated
3D objects and avatars and navigation information allowing visitors to find their way in the
museum galleries. Therefore, the minor contribution as to this new phase of experimentations
would be to highlight some interesting research directions.
260

7.4.1 IMPROVE THE GRAPHIC AND INTERACTION DESIGN

A substantial part of the feedback generated by the evaluation process was relevant with the
graphic and interaction design of the application. The feedback was relevant with missing
functionalities (e.g. the absence of controls for the audio), poor user performance in some critical
tasks (e.g. understanding the role of the “freeze” button or failure to easily activate) or not clear
enough and attractive graphic design (e.g. the pictogram used for the slideshow presentations and
the overall “look and feel” of the graphic design, particularly criticized by the students of Fine
Arts). In addition many participants mentioned not approving the audio delivery through the
UMPC speakers and expressed their wish to have the possibility to “put away” the guide whenever
they feel the need to. All these remarks can be easily taken under consideration in the design and
implementation of the new prototype.

7.4.2 PROVIDE A CONTENT AUTHORING TOOL

Content creation and authoring is a time, money and energy consuming process for most mobile
museum guide projects. However, in our case study, the introduction of a still emerging
technology, mobile AR, complicated this task even further. The content authoring process that
took place after the process of content creation occurring through close collaboration with the
museum representatives was extremely long (approximately 7 to 8 man hours per painting) and
was entirely confided to the IT stakeholders. The creation of a content authoring tool could not
only decrease the time needed to create the multimedia presentations, but also enable museum
curators and educators themselves to create their own content.

7.4.3 IMPLICATE THE TARGET GROUP EARLIER IN THE INTERACTION DESIGN PROCESS

Despite the fact that the sample used for the validation of the mobile AR museum guide
prototype was not large, due to the exploratory nature of the study and the technological
immaturity of the evaluated prototype, several intriguing ideas regarding new applications and new
ways of interaction, came to surface during the evaluation. At the same time the evaluation
process proved that the test group was not only very attentive and critical but also very
demanding. Introducing participatory design and implicating selected representatives of the target
group in earlier stages of the life circle of the project could provide meaningful insights and
further enhance the potential user acceptance of the new prototype.

261

7.4.4 EXPERIMENT WITH LESS INTRUSIVE DISPLAYS

As already mentioned in the critical appraisal of the AR approach, one of the most influential
constraints regarding the AR approach of our mobile museum guide prototype, was the UMPC
terminal and display used. Given that the 2nd phase of the new project plans to deliver the tour
also on a MID (Mobile Internet Device) platform, several new potential directions open up. The
first one would be to compare the acceptance of the UMPC delivered museum tour versus the
MID delivered one. Secondly, delivering the tour on smart phones will render comparisons with
other already existing PDA tours easier. Finally, until mid 2010, it might be possible to envision
the feasibility of experimentations that would use a MID or smartphone as a delivery and
computational platform but a pair of AR goggles as a display. That would not only free the hands
of the participants but also the imagination of the users and the involved stakeholders regarding
new possible ways of interaction with mobile AR applications in the museum context.

7.4.5 EXPERIMENT WITH NEW FUNCTIONS

Regardless of whether it will finally be possible to free from material constraints the targeted users
of the application, the evaluation of the proposed AR prototype identified -through a close and
long collaboration with the recruited participants- several new functions possible to be embedded
in the new AR prototype. Among them, a notes-taking function, several personalized souvenirs
functions and a virtual guest book function coupled with a spatial annotation function that would
give the visitors the possibility to spatially annotate paintings and museum objects. Some of these
new functions are already considered for inclusion in the next AR prototype, as for example the
“paint it” function that has been already implemented and integrated in the guide and now needs
to be validated.

7.4.6 VALIDATE AND
EXPERIMENTATIONS

FURTHER

DELVE

INTO

THE

RESULTS

OF

THE

FIRST

The evaluation phase shed light on several anticipated and unanticipated issues, such as visitors’
acceptance of the proposed mobile museum guide application, visitors’ satisfaction regarding the
content delivered or the role personalization and customization may exercise in the overall user
experience. However, the results of the evaluation phase also brought to light new issues that
should be further investigated in the forthcoming evaluation phases. Are there additional reasons
for which occasional museum goers enjoyed more the proposed application, in comparison with
frequent museum goers? Is the term AR or the technology itself that provoked explicit affective
reactions, observed during the focus groups and one of the survey questions? Are there other
explanations for which the word “playful”, attributed under many circumstances to the guide, was
262

employed by the participants both with a positive and negative connotation? Are there any
correlations between the use of mobile AR and the issue of attentional balance and user
distraction detected, or is this problem simply correlated with the principle of introducing a
mobile multimedia guide in the museum environment? These are only some of the questions that
could be further explored in the next AR prototype evaluation sessions. Finally, given the fact that
the evaluation carried out was qualitative in nature, a cross-checking of the reported results could
also be of strong interest.

7.5 FUTURE WORK WITHIN A LONG-TERM HORIZON

Apart the above mentioned short-term horizon research axes, several new directions, both
regarding the use of mobile multimedia museum guides and mobile AR applications are worth to
be explored more in depth, within a long term horizon. The main axes which are closely related to
our work are examined in this section.

7.5.1 INTRODUCING A LESS TECHNOCENTRIC, VISITOR-ORIENTED DESIGN APPROACH

As we had the chance to see in several occasions, mobile museum guides should not be
considered as a new-age gadget but as an additional, interactive interpretation medium to be used
alongside other existing museum interpretation media. However, often enough museum
professionals express their fears as to the impact the use of a mobile museum guide could have in
the relation developed between a museum visitor and an exposed museum object. Despite the care
undertaken in the conceptual and interaction design of the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes mobile
museum guide, evidence coming from the experimentations proved that such an issue does indeed
exist. How could one cope with this issue, both regarding museum professionals but also the
target group of the application, meaning museum visitors?
Encouraging and enforcing an even more user and visitor-oriented design approach might be a
solution to this problem. More concretely and towards this direction, the research carried out lays
some first foundations by:
A.

Defining current deadlocks to overcome and future challenges as to the introduction of

mobile guides in the museum environment that were subsequently classified under three
categories, human, economical and technological.

263

B.

Proposing a new framework for examining the interactions that occur during a mobile

museum guide escorted visit, introducing seven different interaction variations involving the
museum visitor, the mobile guide, other co-visitors and the museum environment. This approach
allows for a better comprehension of the action-space as well as of the elements that differentiate
MHCI with mobile museum guides as in contrast with other mobile, interactive, multimedia
applications.
C.

Establishing criteria for the classification of mobile multimedia museum guides in order to

more effectively identify possible functional requirements but also in order to tackle down the
main issues a mobile museum guide project seeks to resolve.
D.

Populating an inventory of possible mobile museum guide functions so as to identify

needs, establish requirements, better understand the nature of the “problem-space” context and
lay the foundation for user task analysis.
E.

Introducing a generic evaluation taxonomy scheme for front-end, formative or summative

evaluation, defining three categories of evaluation issues susceptible to arise during the evaluation
and assessment of a mobile multimedia museum guide that may serve as a guide for planning and
conducting evaluation sessions.
As the main research question was the use of AR technologies and the AR metaphor in mobile
museum guides, these user-centered directions need further confirmation and validation.

7.5.2 TAKING UNDER CONSIDERATION THE SOCIAL CHARACTER OF THE VISIT

Several recent studies have proved that museum visiting is in most cases also an activity of social
character, especially among non-frequent visitors for whom sharing the visiting experience may
obtain a greater importance than the educational aspect of the museum visit itself (Hurst et al.,
2002, Hood, 1983). In parallel, an increasing number of cultural institutions are striving to involve
museum visitors in a public dialogue around ideas and exhibits.
Therefore, the possibilities of integration of communication services, edutainment activities or
modules that could link the pre-, during- and post-visit phases acquire a particular meaning that is
still not adequately explored, especially taking under consideration the change that has occurred in
instant, direct, real-time and on-the-go communication among a population exponentially more
familiar with mobile devices and communication services. Another possible future research
direction, still barely explored, is the provision for application modules that would allow linking
264

outdoor and indoor cultural activities. This scenario acquires even more importance in the case of
archeological sites whose findings are exposed in nearby museums. Educational games and
activities could also be of benefit for school groups or visiting families.

7.5.3 CONCEIVE A DEDICATED PLATFORM

The experimentations in the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes used a UMPC device for the
application delivery, among other reasons because the available interaction surface is larger than
the one provided by PDAs which are today the most widely used devices for the delivery of
multimedia museum tours. However neither of these two platforms may be considered to be ideal
for the examined type of application. In this thesis, several possible current and future displays
were examined, but at this time there exists no specific device or display for the delivery of a
multimedia museum tour. A first step towards that direction would be to discuss and establish
requirements by implicating IT specialists, museum professionals and museum visitors. The only
existing example of a specialized mockup was presented in (Kondo et al., 2007), but undeniably
the initiation of a dialogue around this topic could not only assist in establishing requirements but
also in convincing IT companies and professionals that the design and implementation of a
dedicated platform is an issue that is worth to be investigated.

7.5.4 FURTHER
APPLICATIONS

EXPLORE

HUMAN

COMPUTER

INTERACTION

WITH

MOBILE

AR

The issue of candidate delivery platforms is central not only for mobile multimedia museum
guides but also for mobile AR applications as it is very closely related not only with the level of
immersion in mobile AR applications but also with the discovery of new ways of interaction with
the proposed AR systems. The conceptual design and implementation of a dedicated mass-market,
light-weight and low-cost mobile delivery platform could unleash the hidden potential of mobile
AR applications and bring us closer to the discovery of new ways of interacting not solely with
and “augmented” device or display but with an augmented environment.
However until then, a number of necessary steps should be taken in order to establish AR-specific
design guidelines through assessment, evaluation, participatory and user-centered design. This is a
fundamental step as evaluation and user-centered design seems to be still largely underestimated
among the AR community while even when users are early enough implicated in the design
process, they have difficulties in expressing their needs in terms of AR scenarios as they are not
sufficiently aware of the technology’s potential. Re-placing the user, in our case the museum
visitor, on the center of the focus of the AR community might eventually assist in establishing
265

design and evaluation guidelines for mobile AR applications. As demonstrated by the
experimentations in the Museum of Fine Arts even exploratory and medium scale evaluation can
provide useful insights regarding the acceptance of mobile AR applications and reveal
unanticipated outcomes, as was the case with the strong affective reactions provoked to our test
group by the use of the term “Augmented Reality”.
Finally another minor theoretical and methodological contribution regarding AR was also
expressed, necessitating further validation and feedback from the related communities. More in
particular, we proposed an alternative apprehension of AR technologies concentrating on the
nature of the object to augment, instead of concentrating on the ways of augmenting an object, as
proposed by a widely cited article of 1998 (Mackay, 1998). Examining the “what” and not the
“how”, we concluded that an AR application can either a) replace/render a physically non existing
object or b) Visually supplement an existing physical object. Further on, examining the type of
allowed interactions, the second category can be further decomposed in AR applications in which:
1) the augmentation can be manipulated through interaction with the physical object, 2) the
physical object can be manipulated through interaction with the augmentation, 3) only the
augmentation and not the real object can be manipulated. This apprehension of AR could assist in
a more effective understanding of the “problem space” and the enunciation of the most
appropriate per case interaction and implementation solutions.

7.5.5 ELABORATE CONTENT AUTHORING TOOLS

As we already saw in section 7.4.2 one of the goals of the GAMME project currently -and until
mid 2010- under development is the creation of an AR content authoring tool. Content creation
and content authoring are two major procedures in the life circle of augmented and more
“conventional” mobile museum multimedia guides. In this thesis we defined as content creation
the process of scenario and educational resources development, mainly accredited to museum
curators and educators, and as content authoring the stitching of all the produced by content
creation material into a meaningful, attractive and coherent multimedia presentation.
However, almost all of the commercial solutions proposed (with the exception of two according
to the author’s knowledge) do not propose any kind of tools that could facilitate museum curators
and educators in creating, elaborating and implementing their own educational scenarios. This
renders the content application difficult to manage, as for the slightest change or addition, the
content has to be re-authored by IT professionals. This way of proceeding not only alienates
museum professionals from the final application but also stretches the necessary time needed
266

from the conception to the design and implementation of a multimedia guide. In addition already
existing IT applications or digitized educational material cannot be relayed or connected with the
mobile museum guide application. A more meaningful solution would be to create a system that
would allow interconnections between the museum documentation and interpretation databases
and/or other IT applications used for the interpretation of cultural heritage. The problem
becomes even more complicated when mobile AR enters the scene, as at the time of writing, there
exists no easy to handle content authoring tool for AR applications. In conjunction with the
problem of robust, fast and accurate tracking, the situation seems to present many inherent
difficulties.
7.6 ON THE FINISHING LINE

The work carried out during this thesis was the result of interweaving multiple projects,
approaches and disciplines and benefited from long and extensive collaborations with
professionals of different backgrounds; professionals that quite probably, under other
circumstances might have never been met, collaborated or joined forces. This aspect, dictated by
the interdisciplinary nature of the research topic undertaken, was also one of the most challenging
during these four years and not always easy to cope with.
This is also why this adventure has also been so rewarding, hopefully not only for the author, but
also for other partners, persons, projects or institutions that actively contributed to the elaboration
of what at the beginning seemed a peculiar and weird idea to a legitimate research hypothesis
worth to be investigated during PhD thesis project: integrating mobile AR technologies in a
mobile multimedia museum guide. It was mainly the 1st component combined with the 2nd one
that constituted a real challenge; at the time that this work was undertaken no similar effort or case
study was known to exist, at least in the museum context.
Though this work demonstrated that mobile AR is worth to be considered as an adequate and
intuitive alternative for geolocalization, navigation and orientation in the museum environment,
the author believes that much time (not less than 5 years) will be needed before we witness a more
generalised introduction of mobile AR guides in the museum environment. The technology needs
to get more mature, the equipment more affordable and the scientists more user-oriented before
attempting to introduce at a larger scale AR in mobile multimedia museum guidance systems. But
this is not necessarily a compromising constraint, as in the meanwhile mobile multimedia guides
will have much more penetrated the museum setting and will be on their way of becoming the rule
rather than the exception. Museum professionals will be more at ease with the idea of introducing
267

this alternative interpretation medium as a standard offer among other well established and known
practices (guided tours, multimedia kiosks, guided visits etc); the public will be even more
accustomed in manipulating mobile multimedia devices and services, even during a museum visit.
And it is probably at that time that certain dimensions and findings of the undertaken work will be
possible to be authentically assessed and cross-checked; provided that we stayed focused on the
objective rather than the technology.

2.Artist biography
AUDIO [female voice]: Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch and painter, classified as a PostImpressionist. His paintings and drawings include some of the world's best known, most popular and most
expensive pieces. He produced all of his more than 2,000 works, including around 900 paintings and 1100
drawings or sketches, during the last ten years of his life. Most of his best-known works were produced in the final
two years of his life, and in the two months before his death he painted 90 pictures.
He suffered from recurrent bouts of mental illness — about which there are many competing theories — and
during one such episode, famously cut off a part of his left ear.

3.Painting description
AUDIO [female voice]: Vincent van Gogh's The Cafe Terrace stands as one of the painter's most
remarkable works. It is also, without question, one of the most famous produced in Van Gogh's brief but
prolific career. Vincent was enthusiastic about The Cafe Terrace and wrote to his sister Wil:
AUDIO [male voice]: “In point of fact I was interrupted these days by my toiling on a new picture representing the
outside of a night cafe. On the terrace there are tiny figures of people drinking. An enormous yellow lantern sheds its light on
the terrace, the house and the sidewalk, and even causes a certain brightness on the pavement of the street, which takes a
pinkish violet tone…Here you have a night picture without any black in it, done with nothing but beautiful blue and violet
and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square acquires a pale sulphur and greenish citron-yellow colour. It amuses
me enormously to paint the night right on the spot…”
[The café]
AUDIO [female voice]: More than one hundred years after Vincent painted it, the Cafe Terrace is still in Arles
serving drinks to its thirsty patrons. It's now called the Cafe Van Gogh, appropriately enough, and has been remodelled to
appear as it did more than a century ago.

4.Comparison with other works (Starry Nights)
AUDIO [female voice]: This work is the first in a trilogy1 of paintings which feature starlit skies. Starry
Night Over the Rhone came within a month, followed by the popular Starry Night painted the next year in SaintRémy, today in the museum of Modern Art in New York.

5.Comparison with other works
A. Potato eaters
AUDIO [female voice]: The Potato Eaters is a well known early work of Vincent van Gogh
that he painted in April 1885 while in Nuenen, Netherlands. It is housed in the Van Gogh
Museum of Amsterdam.

AUDIO [female voice]: Van Gogh said he wanted to depict peasants as they really were.
AUDIO [male voice]: "I wanted to convey the idea that the people eating potatoes by the light of an oil lamp
used the same hands with which they take food from the plate to work the land that they have toiled with their
hands— that they have earned their food by honest means".

AUDIO [female voice]: He deliberately chose coarse and ugly models, thinking that they would
be natural and unspoiled in his finished work
ACCOMPANYING IMAGES (during this narration): The potatoes eaters

B. Bedroom in Arles
Bedroom in Arles is the title given to each of three similar paintings by Vincent van Gogh.
AUDIO [female voice]: Van Gogh's own title for this composition was simply The Bedroom.
There are three authentic versions described in his letters, easily discernible from one another by
the pictures on the wall to the right. The painting depicts Van Gogh's bedroom at 2, Place
Lamartine in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhône, France, known as his Yellow House. Van Gogh started
the first version mid October 1888 while staying in Arles, and explained his aims and means to
his brother Theo:

299

The bedroom in Arles

AUDIO [male voice]: Well, I have thought that on watching the composition we stop thinking and imagining. I have
painted the walls pale violet. The ground with checked material. The wooden bed and the chairs, yellow like fresh butter; the
sheet and the pillows, lemon light green. The bedspread, scarlet coloured. The window, green. The washbasin, orangey; the
tank, blue. The doors, lilac. And, that is all.

A . SIMP LE TEXT SCRIPT

Georges LALLEMANT,
[Nancy, vers 1575 – Paris, 1636]
La Sainte Famille, première moitié du 17e siècle,
Huile sur toile
115 x 94 cm
achat, 1989
inv. 89.2.1
Elève de Simon VOUET, peintre et graveur, Georges Lallemant est né dans le duché de Lorraine, foyer
artistique alors dominant en Europe. On ne connaît de lui qu'une quinzaine de toiles sûres, peintures
d'histoire, portraits, sujets religieux, récemment réévalués par des historiens de l'art.
Il fut l'un des artistes les plus renommés du commencement du règne de Louis XIII comme en
témoignent les commandes que lui passe la confrérie des Orfèvres en 1630 (le "Mays" de Notre-Dame de
Paris). Dans l'histoire de l'art, on peut dire qu'il a été victime d'un phénomène de mode: son art maniériste
a été effacé par celui des classiques de la génération suivante dont les plus grands, Philippe de
Champaigne, Nicolas Poussin, Laurent de La Hyre ont pourtant fréquenté son atelier.
Les "petits mays" portent le nom d'une manifestation organisées par la communauté des Orfèvres au mois
de mai dans la cathédrale de Paris, entre 1609 et 1629. Ils étaient constitués d'un tabernacle en bois
sculpté, triangulaires et portant de chaque côté 3 petits tableaux enchâssés: l'un figurait habituellement une
scène de la vie de la Vierge, sur les deux autres on pouvait lire des poèmes expliquant le sujet et offrant
des louanges à la Vierge. L'ensemble était suspendu dans la nef de la cathédrale comme en témoigne un
tableau du 17e siècle conservé au musée de Notre-Dame.
De Georges Lallemant, nous connaissons un autre Petit May, Saint Pierre et saint Jean guérissant le paralytique à
la porte du Temple, conservé à l'église de Saint-Chéron dans l'Essonne.
(1) Description
Au premier plan, une femme, vêtue d'une robe rouge flottante et d'un manteau bleu tient un linge blanc
sur lequel est posé un tout jeune enfant aux cheveux blonds. Ces différents attributs confirment qu'il s'agit
d'une représentation de la Vierge et de l'Enfant Jésus, ils sont entourés de Joseph et de l'Ange et forment
la Sainte Famille. La figure centrale de la Vierge est accentuée par le volume de sa coiffe, qui lui tient lieu
d'auréole. A l'arrière plan sur la droite, Joseph, d'un air placide observe la scène tandis que sur la gauche, à
l'arrière plan également, l'Ange fait un geste protecteur vers la mère et l'enfant.
(2) Analyse technique
La composition de cette scène transmet une impression d'étrangeté à plusieurs degrés. Le visage de la
Vierge plonge dans la pénombre selon un raccourci qui semble spécifique au peintre. On retrouve en
effet cette "manière" dans une œuvre antérieure, conservée au musée de Varsovie, Georges prompt à la soupe
(Figure A).
Les personnages sont rassemblés dans une proximité spatiale très resserrée. Les proportions telles qu'elles
sont attribuées aux figures restent arbitraires ; ainsi, les personnages de Joseph et de l'Ange semblent très
en retrait par rapport à la figure centrale de la Vierge. Enfin, les drapés sont envahissants. Ce sont là les
traces d'un maniérisme finissant.
Le laboratoire de recherche des musées de France, en 1989, avait effectué une série d'examens de l'œuvre.
L'examen dans l'infrarouge a mis en évidence un léger repentir sur le profil de l'ange. Il restitue l'ampleur
initiale du voile de la Vierge, retombant sur son épaule, rendu peu perceptible par un coup de pinceau
ancien qui assombrit le vêtement de l'ange (Figure B).
La fluorescence ultraviolette (non disponible aujourd'hui) montre de nombreux repeints récents, excessifs
par rapport à l'état de conservation satisfaisant qui a révélée la radiographie.

303

Jusqu'à récemment, sous couvert de restauration et de conservation, on a ainsi modifié légèrement
l'intégrité de certaines œuvres.
(3) Iconographie
La représentation de la Sainte Famille est déclinée en abondance à travers l'histoire de l'art en Europe. Les
rares sources bibliques connues proviennent de quelques versets de l'évangile de Matthieu. Emile Mâle a
évoqué l'importance des récits apocryphes pour l'art médiéval. Ici, le sujet reste très libre, mettant en
évidence la Vierge et l'Enfant, les personnages de Joseph (très pensif) et de l'ange se déployant davantage
comme des figures décoratives destinées à consolider la composition.
(4)

Contexte d'apparition de l'œuvre

Le style maniériste, quoique tardif, est reconnaissable dans la composition de ce tableau qui se traduit par
une impression d'étrangeté dans la composition. Les personnages sont rassemblés dans une proximité
spatiale très resserrée, les proportions attribuées aux figures restent arbitraires et les drapés envahissants.
Le visage de la Vierge plonge dans la pénombre selon un raccourci spécifique au peintre. On retrouve en
effet cette "manière" dans une œuvre de l'artiste, conservée au musée de Varsovie, Georges prompt à la
soupe.[trouver la photo ?]
La robe plissée de la Vierge occupe une partie importante de la composition et répond en contrepoint à
l'ellipse des langes de l'Enfant. La coiffe qui tient lieu d'auréole est dite "à la bohémienne" que l'on
retrouve chez Claude Vignon.
Les traits de la Vierge doivent être rapprochés de ceux du Christ de la chapelle Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs
de Vic, permettant de dater plus précisément l'œuvre : 1621 (Figure C).
Rapprocher le dessin du Louvre de La Sainte Famille, exécuté en 1623 semble-t-il : les deux enfants sont
très proches dans leur facture.

La femme entre les deux âges, Anonyme français, XVIème siècle, vers 1575

(1) Description
La femme entre les deux âges
Peintre anonyme français, vers 1575
La datation de ce tableau est approximative, le titre a été donné à une période récente et le peintre nous
est inconnu... Nous ignorons aussi à qui appartenait l'œuvre avant son entrée dans les collections, au tout
début du XIXème siècle. Le raffinement des costumes et l'érotisme de la scène rappelle aussi le style de
l'Ecole de Fontainebleau né à la cour de François Ier, quarante ans plus tôt, sous l'influence de quelques
peintres italiens.
Mais si l'histoire du tableau demeure mystérieuse, le thème représenté est très fréquemment traité dans la
deuxième moitié du XVIème s.
Le Musée de Rennes possède d'ailleurs une version très proche dans laquelle la jeune femme est habillée.

Il existe également une gravure anonyme conservée à la Bibliothèque Nationale, accompagnée du poème
suivant :

Ecole française du 16eme siècle, la femme entre les deux âges, gravure, collection de la bibliothèque nationale

"Voyez ce vieux pénard, enveloppé dans sa mante
Les bras croisés gémir ce qu'il veut et ne peut.
La belle gentiment de deux doigts lui présente
Ses lunettes disant que grand tort il se deut
D'ailleurs rend son mignon plein d'une amour plaisante,
Serre son petit doigt et veut tout ce qu'il veut.
Bonhomme, tenez vos lunettes
Et regardez bien qui vous n'êtes
De l'âge propre aux jeux d'amours
Un chacun cherche son semblable
Souffrez qu'un autre plus valable
Cueille le fruit de mes beaux jours.
Trois personnages occupent le premier plan: à gauche, un couple, à droite, un vieil homme.
Le peintre donne très peu de détail sur le contexte de la scène. L'architecture suggérée lui permet surtout,
par le tracé d'une ligne de fuite avec la corniche, de suggérer une profondeur.

(2)

Analyse Technique

Les couleurs choisies dans les gammes sombres mais assez chaudes pour le vêtement des hommes mettent
en valeur la carnation du corps féminin soulignée par la transparence blanche, plus froide, du voile.
Un examen attentif de la toile montre des reprises très importantes et une patte différente beaucoup plus
épaisse sur les cotes gauche et droit du tableau ainsi qu'en haut. Doit-on y voir une modification du format
de l'œuvre? Seul un examen radiographique l'assurerait. (Plaquette pédagogique)

Analyse du Sujet

La jeune femme attire notre attention dès notre entrée dans la salle. Parce qu'elle est le seul personnage de
face, par la nudité et la pâleur de son corps. Et, bien sûr, par le regard qu'elle nous adresse et qui nous
suit, où que nous soyons dans la salle. Le voile qui la couvre laisse voir, il révèle plus qu'il ne cache.
Comme ses bijoux, il met en valeur un corps. Par un léger déhanché, la jeune femme s'appuie contre son
amant. Entre le pouce et l'index droits, elle serre son petit doigt.

De la main gauche, elle présente un pair de bésicles au vieil homme.

Le jeune homme est richement vêtu de soie, satin et velours. Sur sa toque gansée, se dresse un ensemble
de plume or et argent. La perle qu'il porte à l'oreille permet de dater le tableau, car c'est le roi Henri III,
monarque esthète et extravagant, qui à lancé cette coutume.

308

Anonyme, portrait d'Henri III, huile sur bois, musée de châteaux de Versailles et de Trianon

Notre jeune premier a posé la main gauche sur l'épaule de la jeune femme et de l'autre, frôle avec
délicatesse son sein droit. L'ombre portée sur la joue de sa compagne révèle la proximité du couple.
Troisième acteur, le vieil homme est vêtu d'une chausse et d'un pourpoint rouge vermillon couvert d'un
long manteau aux amples manches, noir, ourlé et doublé de fourrure. Il porte une toque noire. Ce
vêtement, c'est celui que portaient les riches marchands de Venise, à la fin du XVIème siècle.
Tout en regardant les bésicles qu'on lui présente, il fait des deux mains un geste évoquant le compte de
l'argent…
L'auteur du tableau a construit l'intrigue par de subtils jeux de mains et de regards. Aux avances du riche
vieillard, la jeune femme répond par un geste aussi élégant que dédaigneux : elle lui rend ses bésicles
comme pour lui rappeler son âge avancé. De l'autre main, elle pince le petit doigt du jeune homme en
signe d'approbation.
(4)
Contexte d'apparition de cette œuvre
La réunion des amoureux et du vieillard ainsi que certains costumes sont inspirés de la comédie italienne,
introduite progressivement en France à partir de 1571. Très populaire, la Comedia dell'Arte, née en Italie au
milieu du XVIème s était interprétée par des troupes itinérantes de comédiens professionnels qui jouaient
masqués des personnages stéréotypés et improvisaient sur des scénarios réglés d'avance.

309

Porbus, Commedia dell'arte a la cour de Charles IX, 1540-1584, Bayeux, Musée Baron Gérard
La Femme entre les deux âges pourrait bien représenter une scène comique avec les personnages de
Pantalone, Horace et Lucia. Pantalone, vieux marchand vénitien est le prototype de l'amoureux âgé et
berné.

Pantalone, vu par Maurice Sand, en 1860

310

Horace et Lucia forment un jeune couple d'amoureux inséparables, beaux et vêtus à la dernière mode,
ingénieux pour tromper les vieillards.

Personnages de la comédie italienne, Musée de Beaux Arts de Béziers, Hôtel Fabregat
Ce thème a eu un succès énorme si on en juge par le grand nombre des œuvres que l'on peut y rattacher.
Mais presque toutes semblent issues plutôt de la gravure de Perret datée de 1579 dans laquelle les
personnages portent des costumes très archaïsants, sans doute flamands.

Comparaison: Gravure du Perret et Femme entre les Deux Ages, (habillée )

L'une de ces nombreuses versions est conservée a Rennes (inv. D.52.1.1, huile sur bois). L'attitude des
personnages sont strictement les mêmes, hormis la geste du vieillard qui, comme dans la gravure
s'enveloppe ici dans son manteau. D'autres peintures très proches sont connues au musée du Prado a
Madrid, a la Scottish National Portrait Gallery d'Edingburg, a une collection privée parisienne, tandis que
le Metropolitan Museum of Art a New York possède une version "abrégée" ou les deux amants figurent
seuls.

311

La femme entre les deux âges, collection particulier, Paris
Ces copies sont très lies chronologiquement. Mais depuis la fin du XVIe siècle le thème n'a pas eu de
suite, sans doute parce qu'il s'attachait trop étroitement a l'esthétique et a l'esprit de l'Ecole de
Fontainebleau comme aux premiers rencontres avec la Commedia dell’arte.
(5)
Attribution
Mentionné a partir de 1803 dans les collections du musée, cette œuvre aujourd'hui célèbre, a fait l'objet
d'innombrables conjectures. Attribue d'abord à Holbein, puis à l'école Florentine, elle est en fait très
caractéristique de l'école de Fontainebleau., qui nait suite a la reconstruction de 1528 du château, pendant
laquelle plusieurs artistes italiennes deviennent actifs dans le cours royale influençant aussi les artistes
français. Sous l'aimable prétexte de la mythologie, le nu féminin profane devient partout présent à
Fontainebleau.

Aussi précises soient-elles, descriptions et explications historiques n'enlèvent pas le mystère du tableau…
A qui était-il destiné? Où était-il installé? Vu les ressemblances, faut-il voir dans le personnage du jeune
premier un portrait du roi Henri III lui-même? Les interprétations, plus ou moins fantaisistes sont

312

multiples…A chacun d'imaginer par exemple quelle pourrait être la scène précédente! A chacun
d'inventer un autre titre pour cette œuvre!
Car cette jeune femme continue, à travers les siècles, d'interpeller en silence chaque spectateur sur le
choix qu'elle fait entre deux âges, entre deux hommes.

PRESENTATION DE L'ETUDE
Bonjour,
Vous participerez à une visite du musée des Beaux-Arts de Rennes dans le cadre de la conception et de
l'évaluation d'un prototype de guide de musée multimédia. Votre participation se situe dans le cadre d’une
étude scientifique liée à la conception de guides multimédia pour la visite culturelle, et plus
particulièrement, en utilisant des technologies de Réalité Augmentée. Notre but n'est pas seulement de
tester cette maquette mais aussi de l’améliorer et d’envisager d'autres fonctionnalités, avec votre aide.
Voici la manière dont l'expérimentation va se dérouler:
1) Dans un premier temps et pendant quelques minutes nous vous présenterons le dispositif et ses
fonctionnalités.
2) Ensuite, vous pourrez effectuer une visite thématique, sur le thème du costume, dans 3 salles, dans
lesquelles se trouvent les quatre œuvres (tableaux) commentées. Vous serez cependant libres de déambuler
et d’observer d’autres œuvres qui peuvent vous intéresser.
Pendant votre visite vous serez équipé d'un dispositif numérique (dimensions :22 cm x 15cm , poids:
800g) .
Celui-ci vous permettra d'approfondir votre interaction avec les quatre tableaux présents dans ces trois
pièces. On vous demandera également de porter un bandeau sur la tête qui sera équipé d'une caméra
discrète, qui nous permettra de filmer vos sessions et votre interaction avec le dispositif.
Dans la mesure où le dispositif d'enregistrement est contraignant, nous vous demanderons lorsque vous
utilisez le dispositif de réalité augmentée de le pointer vers les œuvres.
De plus, bien que vous puissiez vous promener librement au sein des trois salles, nous vous demandons
de vous arrêter devant chaque tableau pour lequel des informations apparaîtront sur l’écran.
3) Cette visite sera suivie d'un entretien. Nous estimons que la visite suivie de l'entretien dureront au total
à peu près une heure et demie. (+/- 10 min).
4) Enfin, un mois après la visite, vous devrez répondre à cinq questions par email.
5) Entre-temps, une séance de focus d'une heure environ vous sera également proposée début-novembre
pour revenir sur votre expérience de visite. Cela sera le moment d'exprimer vos propres avis, opinions et
idées par rapport au dispositif que vous avez utilisé et aussi de dialoguer et réagir avec d'autres
participants.
Une rémunération est prévue par le biais de chèques kadeos utilisables dans de nombreuses enseignes
dont la FNAC:
- 50 euros seront prévus pour la participation aux 4 phases
- 40 euros seront prévus pour la participation aux trois premières phases
Enfin, une fois sur place pour la visite, nous vous demanderons de signer le document de droit à l'image
ainsi que de participation et rémunération reçue en conséquence.
Tous vos coordonnes ainsi que tout détail d'ordre personnel sera traité avec la plus grande discrétion. On
aimerait cependant vous prévenir que les résultats de ces expérimentations sont susceptibles d’être
divulgués dans des revues ou colloques scientifiques.
N'hésitez pas à nous contacter si vous avez d'autres questions concernant cette expérimentation.
Cordialement,
Areti Damala

APPENDIX V: SOME INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS

327

328

INTERVIEW, Florence, 1st year of studies, Social Sciences Student
Interviewer: Would you mind tell me how old are you and which year of studies you are attending at the
university?
Student: I am a 1st year student and I am 19 years old.
Interviewer: Let me write that down, first year …
Interviewer: So, how was it?
Student: Eh…good…
Interviewer: Was it easy or hard to locate the paintings?
Student: No, it was easy.
Interviewer: OK then… Do you think that the structure of the content was clear enough? I mean the
different thematic axes present for each painting?
Student: Yeah…but there were too many things present at the same time and it is not easy to retain all at
once… but otherwise the content was rich, there were many things.
Interviewer: Was there anything that caused particular problems or a kind of presentation that was not easy
to follow?
Student: No. There was nothing that perturbed me.
Interviewer: Do you think that it (the guide) helped you to approach or comprehend the subject depicted or
did it rather distract you from contemplating the painting or both at the same time?
Student: (I would say) it rather provided me with...helped me better understand the painting. I found it very
interesting to see how the painting was made, all the “behind”, like the artist’s point of view…
Interviewer: I see…
Student: But then there are things that ….hem…for example in the life of the artist, that are interesting, but
maybe not necessary.
Interviewer: Uh?
Student: I don’t know if I expressed myself clearly…
Interviewer: It is very interesting for us to have all points of view and receive positive and negative
comments for the guide…so as to see what goes fine and what maybe not so fine…
Student: Eh, no, it is true that using the guide was quite playful, this is not bad, and then it allows as having
interpretation material on hand.
Interviewer: Was there any content that you enjoyed more than others?
Student: Ah…Yes of course. The “context” and the “artist” themes, and then the “description” as well,
because as we have the painting right in front of us, we can see…
Interviewer: Speaking generally, would you say that you like visiting museums often, regularly, a lot?

329

Student: I like a lot visiting, but I do not visit regularly… when I am in places where I have not been
before, I visit a lot but I am not crazy about museums as well.
Interviewer: When you visit, do you usually prefer being alone or you prefer going with friends?
Student: More with other people, so that we can as well discuss, because it’s funny to see the impression a
painting can make to different people. But I like visiting alone as well.
Interviewer: And once you are in a museum, if an object appeals to you, how do you do to obtain more
information? Do you use interpretation material if there is any available?
Student: Yes, yes…I try to…First, I observe a lot the painting with attention, then I read the information
next to it (the etiquettes), if there is interpretation material it is even better.
Interviewer: Is there any interpretation material that you prefer among others? Like text, audio, guided
visits?
Student: Guided visits no. I prefer that (alternative) interpretation material is proposed to me, so that I can
choose…I find that a guided visit often is a bit…well then of course it depends on the place as well…but
the guided visit is a bit too guided…the personal choice in a museum is important, like being able to pass
from one painting to another if we like, being able to choose, you see?
Interviewer: I see…
Student: Then I am also thinking about audio guides, but…it is the same, we don’t find them everywhere.
Interviewer: It’s true…
Interviewer: So, if a guide like this one was available in the museum, of course without all this additional
equipment you had to wear, do you think you would give it a try?
Student: Yes, I think. Because we can choose the information we want, and then we choose as well the
order. Personally I think I would use it.
Interviewer: So you told me before that you think the structure was clear. Were the types of media available
under each theme comprehensible?
Student: Yes, yes it was quite clear, except maybe for the two black squares…
Interviewer: Yes of course, it was the pictogram we chose for the slideshows.
……….
INTERVIEW, Simon, 3rdt year of studies, Social Sciences Student
Interviewer: Simon, would you mind telling me how old are you?
Student: I am 20 years old
Interviewer: Would you say you visit museums rarely, often or frequently?
Student: I am putting myself on it more and more
Interviewer: I see…

330

Student: It is not a habit I have since I was little, but by growing up, I started finding it more and more
interesting, and now, whenever I find the chance, yes, I go…
Interviewer: How is your relation regarding New Technologies, like Internet, mobile phones or related
gadgets?
Student: I am hopeless (laughs)…But I start to get myself using to the idea, as we are required more and
more to know a minimum…I was obliged last year to buy a PC, for example, which was something I had
never considered before, so when I bought one, by using it…and as I like a lot music… you know there is
plenty of software that is very good for music, for guitar in particularly, things like that, so by trying and
using all that stuff, we start to get used.
Interviewer: I see.
Student: But that does not mean that this is my favourite hobby.
Interviewer: So you don’t really use them by obligation, but more for fun and it is this way you started
learning things on computers.
Student: Yes, exactly. And then I like having things in order; so instead of having files here and there…I
bought myself an external hard disk. But the more I use them, the more I like to have performant material
that works well….But I still get lost, in comparison with others… (laughs)
Interviewer: Let me get back in museum visiting now. When you visit do you usually prefer visit alone or
accompanied?
Student: Ah! It depends with whom…Because me, my look on the works, is something very personal. So
for example, a person that does not have the same look , it is difficult, so in this case, we might go
together, but each one will be progressing in his own pace…Or we might share the liking for the same
works, but this can be very different from person to person. But then it really depends on the person. For
example I recently did a visit with a friend (female) that explained me many things on the painting. She is
studying history of art, so she had lot of knowledge that she could give, and that is a very interesting
example of a visit made by two. On the contrary making a visit with somebody that does not have the
same likings as ours… in this case splitting up and making individually our own visit could be better.
Interviewer: So, let’s say that we are in the museum, alone or accompanied, do you have a particular method
of approaching, looking or understanding the object that interests you? Do you like just watching or do
you fancy finding information, resources available? Like text provided by the museum or audio guides?
Student: There are three things in a painting. First of all there are the senses (meaning the feeling) what the
painting transmits us. For example, the faces, the emotions, or everything else that belongs to this
category. Then there is the beauty. Eh…..The beauty both ways. The beauty with its philosophical sense
or what is represented. Is it a scene of war or another historic event? And then the beauty in terms of
aesthetics... Do I like it or not? And the third point is the technique.
Interviewer: So you are also interested by the technique.
Student: Yes, and very much indeed. Very much because it happens to me to see painting so as to
understand how other artists do, that gives us new ideas and invites us to compare and to see.. Whether it
is a sculptor or a painter…all this. Like for example in the painting we saw a while ago, the fact that the
painting was reframed and both frames were preserved…These are small aspects and things that I like
discovering in paintings.
Interviewer: So, here comes a hypothetical question.
Student: Hum hum …

331

Interviewer: Let’s say that a guide like that is available and it does not contain only 4 paintings but maybe 10
or 12 or 14. Do you finally think that this is something that could help you understand the context of the
painting a bit better? Or do you think on the contrary that it would rather distract you? It’s the one or the
other? Or, maybe, both at the same time?
Student: Well, it depends. I think that the guide is very interesting, it provides us with amazing things, the
comprehension and the knowledge, but you have to be careful in watching also the painting on its own
and take the time to see the things. I think it is also interesting to have the time to see the painting on it’s
own where we analyse what we see, and then we can have a guide that explains us the technique, the
context and the artist, and then have some more time, to re-see the painting on it’s own and compare with
the feelings it provoked us at first. It’s like that we are constructing ourselves a personal feeling or
apprehension of the painting. Yes, yes, I think it is interesting. Personally I like it a lot.
Interviewer: What would be the advantages or the disadvantages regarding other ways of media available in
the museum, more conventional in nature? Text, museum provided texts or audio guides?
Student: What I liked is that we can replay the information we like. Well then of course, one has to be
careful so that the guide does not take the place of the work. At the beginning, I felt a bit this. I had this
thing in my hands, and my look was focused on it. Despite the fact that I had the painting just in front of
me, at the beginning it was the guide I was looking. But then, I started taking my time. When there was
only the audio I was watching… Then what else I could say for the prototype I used, hem…, there were
images for example, where there were no references. So there we don’t know what we see, who did it and
why, all these…There are certain ones for which we don’t know. Then it was also the fact that holding the
guide just in front of the eyes was a bit tiring…and it also interfered with watching the painting …but I
guess that this configuration was only for the trial.
Interviewer: What I find interesting, is that if a kind of mistake slips in it becomes apparent, which is not the
case with audio guides or text (one should be a specialist) but many of you made this remark, a thing that
shows that you were careful to what you were watching and seeing.
Student: It’s better to adopt a critical view of things but still I find the comparison images were not
referenced either their scale or dimensions.
Interviewer: … Did you observe that there was a bar with the title on top of each painting presented?
Student: Yes, I did.
Interviewer: We feared that it might not be visible enough …. We would really like to discuss other aspects
like these with you in the workshop. But otherwise do you think the themes were comprehensible?
Student: Yes, I think that analysis should be at the end, at my opinion. So I did this only at the end. I did
not understand if there is an order, or we could do the things differently.
Student: Oh, and in Picasso there was a text and an audio. The text was very small and I did not have my
glasses, I tried to read it and then I passed on the audio, and then I realized that it is the same thing…
Interviewer: Yes, you are right. But what I would like to ask you in this case, is do you think that the same
kind of information should be delivered using different media? Would that help?
Student: Of course, it can be very interesting, then it depends for which public, that is also what I asked
Pascal (note: a member of the research team) before starting the experimentation, for which public? So as
to know how I am going to “judge” it…If it could touch a maximum of the public that would be great. It
is nice to have audio, text, eh, all these… Then if they are the same, they have to be grouped together. I
would like being able to pause in the audio and think or go back and rehear something if I want.

332

Student: Another technical thing as well is that the Picasso painting was small so when I approached, the
images of the themes moved, some of them were outside the screen.
……
INTERVIEW, Marie-Laure, 1st year of studies, Fine Arts Student
Interviewer: I am going to ask you some questions now, quite quickly as it seems that we do not have much
time.
Student: I am ready.
Interviewer: So you told me you are at the 2nd year of your studies in the School of Fine Arts and how old
are you?
Student: I am 20 years old.
Interviewer: Would you say you visit museum rarely, regularly or often?
Student: I would say very regularly.
Interviewer: And usually when you are in a gallery or a museum you prefer being alone or with friends?
Student: Either with friends with the same background so as to discuss…but… I like a lot visiting alone as
well. Generally, most of the times, I visit museums on my own.
Interviewer: And what is your preferred interpretation material once in a museum? How do you usually
proceed?
Student: Already what really irritates me in contemporary art is that there is not an enormous offer in terms
of interpretation, so that annoys me a little bit… I like a lot having text, actually. Whatever is audio guide,
I do not like a lot… because I find that my attention goes away very soon…except if there is a (human)
guide
Interviewer: Now, a somewhat arduous question as we came upon some problems during your visit…
(laughs)
Student: (laughs)
Interviewer: Given the fact that you visit museums, and that you usually prefer using text, the fact of having
a multimedia guide your hands, what did it give? Did it distract you? How did things pass? Not necessarily
at the beginning, because in the beginning we need some time to adjust ourselves…
Student: Yes, we need some time to adjust…
Interviewer: But when you got at ease…
Student: Well already, I found very interesting the fact of having the image and the text, and that the text is
active, I liked it more than the audio.
Interviewer: And whatever was image that appeared alongside with audio? How was the combination?
Student: Eh, maybe a bit too…eh I prefer taking my time by myself to read a text…because when we have
only the audio, we absorb some things but other things are put aside, while with the text we take our time.
But the combination of appearing images and text was a very good one.

333

Interviewer: In terms of structure of the content, were things clear enough?
Student: Yes, everything was clear
Interviewer: Trying to make an abstraction, you think that using the guide was easy or too complicated?
Student: (laughs) I would say that it’s me who didn’t understand everything from the beginning…
Interviewer: No…
Student: I didn’t! I am not very gifted in terms of Information Technologies (laughs).
Student: Well, I think there is an adaptation time, but once we understand how it works, it’s the same, but I
would say that it’s the same in the case of an audio guide as well, we don’t catch directly which button we
have to press at the beginning
Interviewer: Right…I see… ere I am tempted to ask you something because you said that you use text quite
a lot but you have also used audio guides. So here is the question…
Student: Yes…
Interviewer: Let’s say that you are in the museum with the interpretation medium that you have already
chosen, either it is text or audio…and you see a painting and you want to have more information, how do
you usually proceed?
Student: If we have the audio guide or what?
Interviewer: Actually, what I want to ask you is how you identify the piece of information that will help
you… I mean you walk with a printed guide…
Student: A, yes. Actually the first thing that I do is to take the museum brochures and I prefer in general, I
take a look quickly so as to have a personal opinion on what I see before I read but then I take the time to
read and I go back to see elements that interest me or and that I might have not seen…but the text is also
“heavy” some times. You see, recently I was at the exhibition at the …(centre of contemporary art, in
Rennes) this week, so they gave as text that was without images, without anything. We are much less
attracted to read in comparison with the multimedia guide, so this way it is much easier to read.
Interviewer: And in terms of navigation in the information in this case and identification of information,
with the combination of image and text was it more or less difficult to go through the content?
Student: It was much more interesting than having only text
Interviewer: OK. That’s all very interesting and I would like as very much to discuss some of these topics in
the workshops that will follow
Student: Is the system proposed very immature in terms of technology?
Interviewer: Not as much as that.
(…A small discussion about AR follows)

moderator museums and museum visiting
TC
00:32:57.900 - 00:32:59.160
moderator (topic introduced : the reasons for which the participating students visit or do not visit museums quite
often)
TC
00:33:19.830 - 00:33:22.880
Elise
TC

the price !
00:33:30.670 - 00:33:31.870

moderator (most students laugh at this point)
TC
00:33:31.840 - 00:33:32.480
Johan
TC

you also have to take the time
00:33:37.870 - 00:33:39.490

Johan
TC

it’s much easier to find other things to do
00:33:42.570 - 00:33:45.030

……………..
Elise
TC

you have to give yourself the time to do this
00:33:57.940 - 00:33:59.590

Marine it can take long
TC
00:34:05.610 - 00:34:07.650
Simon for me too it is also to find the time but it is also the length (of the visit)
TC
00:34:16.770 - 00:34:18.980
Simon I don’t know if (it is because) I am lazy
TC
00:34:19.330 - 00:34:21.040
Simon but it is also the price
TC
00:34:21.720 - 00:34:22.970
moderator what is your image of the museum as a leisure environment ?
TC
00:34:38.890 - 00:34:41.750
Elise
TC

it is not because you get older that suddenly
00:35:36.140 - 00:35:38.650

Elise
TC

you get the habit to go and see a museum
00:35:39.280 - 00:35:41.660

Elise
TC

people might feel like going to a museum
00:35:42.360 - 00:35:44.880

Elise
TC

but I think that you have to be initiated
00:35:46.680 - 00:35:49.030

Elise
TC

by parents, friends, the school, by somebody
00:35:49.510 - 00:35:51.780

360

Elise
TC

it is not (always) a spontaneous initiative
00:35:57.910 - 00:35:59.420

Marine we often hesitate to go because we are not necessarily informed
TC
00:35:59.390 - 00:36:02.090
Marine and in front of a painting we feel a bit «limited»…
TC
00:36:02.820 - 00:36:07.270
moderator you think that we have the tendency to visit more often if somebody has initiated us ?
TC
00:36:36.030 - 00:36:39.040
Simon (yes) either we talk about information so as to be able to see the painting
TC
00:36:42.820 - 00:36:46.070
Simon to evaluate it, to say whether we like it or not
TC
00:36:46.440 - 00:36:50.240
Simon but it is also (museum visiting) an habit
TC
00:36:54.170 - 00:36:57.330
Simon either we talk about a museum or another environment, I mean that….
TC
00:36:57.440 - 00:36:58.970
Elise this can be applied to the entire cultural domain, if we don’t have the habit to
go to the theatre
TC
00:37:05.420 - 00:37:09.740
Elise
TC

when we are young we will not (necessarily) go when we are older
00:37:10.000 - 00:37:13.390

moderator what is the most difficult thing once we are in a museum ?
TC
00:37:16.810 - 00:37:19.890
Marlene you have to understand the works (objects)
TC
00:37:31.140 - 00:37:33.620
moderator understand the works, yes this is important…
TC
00:37:33.780 - 00:37:35.620
Florence even if you are initiated and have visited museums
TC
00:37:41.330 - 00:37:44.290
moderator could you please talk a bit louder?
TC
00:37:44.770 - 00:37:46.980
Florence I say that even if you are initiated and have the habit to make cultural visits
TC
00:37:51.290 - 00:37:53.320
Florence you do not necessarily understand all the works
TC
00:37:57.670 - 00:38:00.760
moderator (Florence seems to be quite intimidated at this point)
TC
00:37:58.080 - 00:37:59.670
moderator when you are in front of a work and you do not manage
TC
00:38:06.470 - 00:38:09.490
moderator to « decode » it
TC
00:38:14.090 - 00:38:16.560

361

moderator which are your feelings ?
TC
00:38:18.380 - 00:38:20.660
Elise
TC

suddenly we don’t feel at our place
00:38:25.620 - 00:38:27.210

Marine yes
TC
00:38:27.120 - 00:38:28.020
Marine me, I try to understand, but
TC
00:38:28.130 - 00:38:31.270
Marine apparently, pfff...
TC
00:38:36.460 - 00:38:38.730
Marine well, we let go… (meaning “we abandon”)
TC
00:38:40.510 - 00:38:42.920
Marine because if we don’t have someone or something to help us…
TC
00:38:42.960 - 00:38:45.230
Marine there are historical references and everything…
TC
00:38:46.120 - 00:38:49.610
Marine we are not supposed to know everything…
TC
00:38:49.830 - 00:38:53.060
moderator of course not…
TC
00:38:52.310 - 00:38:53.720
Marine no, but it’s clear
TC
00:38:54.330 - 00:38:56.370
Marine it’s for this reason that it is good to have guides (meaning multimedia guides) or things like that
TC
00:38:56.370 - 00:39:00.180
Johan
TC

me, I am not disturbed…
00:38:58.210 - 00:38:59.930

Johan
TC

even if I don’t understand, and I get pleasure just by watching
00:39:00.480 - 00:39:03.230

Johan
TC

I am not blocked to go to a museum
00:39:03.580 - 00:39:06.390

Johan
TC

without any explications (meaning « interpretation media ») and see things and then
00:39:06.660 - 00:39:08.930

Johan
TC

I make my own story
00:39:08.950 - 00:39:10.730

Johan
TC

even if I don’t have any explication it will not
00:39:10.920 - 00:39:13.490

Johan
TC

necessarily disturb me more than that
00:39:13.610 - 00:39:16.060

Johan
TC

I am happy, I have seen things
00:39:16.060 - 00:39:17.900

Johan
TC

I’ve seen a work
00:39:20.300 - 00:39:21.810

362

Florence yes, because at times having an explanation might guide our vision of the work
TC
00:39:21.810 - 00:39:23.740
Johan
TC

yeah
00:39:23.820 - 00:39:24.490

Florence while if we have nothing
TC
00:39:25.420 - 00:39:27.650
Florence we are just in front and it is our imagination that makes everything…
TC
00:39:27.650 - 00:39:29.810
……………………………………………………
moderator (introducing the subject of the content provided through the AR guide)
TC
00:49:10.570 - 00:49:14.560
Elise
TC

the two things that I found most funny
00:49:36.140 - 00:49:39.400

Elise
TC

it was when we had these « stains » on the painting
00:49:47.440 - 00:49:50.720

Elise
TC

and suddenly we saw..hem…
00:49:50.800 - 00:49:54.050

moderator you mean the infrared photos ?
TC
00:49:53.820 - 00:49:55.550
Elise
TC

yes, exactly !
00:49:55.550 - 00:49:57.830

Marine yes, that was very nice…
TC
00:49:56.920 - 00:49:59.090
Elise
TC

and the other thing was…
00:49:59.420 - 00:50:02.760

Elise
TC

when the guide focused in small parts of the painting
00:50:02.820 - 00:50:05.970

Elise some small parts (meaning « the details ») and suddenly we saw things that we had not seen (meaning
“observed”)
TC
00:50:06.250 - 00:50:09.440
Elise
TC

it drew our attention on the details not on the painting as a whole
00:50:09.670 - 00:50:13.140

moderator Johan?
TC
00:50:27.460 - 00:50:28.410
Johan
TC

I really liked the details
00:50:28.600 - 00:50:30.720

Johan but the infrared photos do not speak to me, I don’t know if I saw that or not
TC
00:50:30.990 - 00:50:34.260
Johan or if I did, it did not mark me
TC
00:50:35.490 - 00:50:37.430

363

…………………………………………………….
Marine me I would say that we should have a headset because at times...
TC
00:51:35.350 - 00:51:37.490
Johan
TC

yes, this is very important, it’s not that it would be more funny but…(he means “it is necessary”)
00:51:37.500 - 00:51:39.760

moderator (other participants agree on that point… Florence, Marlene)
TC
00:51:38.490 - 00:51:40.330
Marlene (Marlene reproduces the move of approaching the guide close to the ears to listen the commentaries)
TC
00:51:46.790 - 00:51:48.640
Johan
TC

(Johan as well...)
00:51:48.540 - 00:51:49.910

Johan and then we can not see the images because we are like that (meaning “we have to approach the guide to
our ears and holding this position we can not see the content passing by)
TC
00:51:49.910 - 00:51:51.880
…………………………………………………….
Simon I also started feeling pain in the shoulders (meaning “from holding the device”)
TC
00:53:28.640 - 00:53:31.580
Marine I don’t know, personally I did not have any problems with that
TC
00:53:39.900 - 00:53:42.300
Marine it did not tire me because…
TC
00:53:42.370 - 00:53:44.510
Johan
TC

me, I directed the camera towards the painting
00:53:44.250 - 00:53:46.140

Marine yes but you could just activate « pause »
TC
00:53:46.080 - 00:53:47.820
Elise
TC

yes, you had to use the « pause » button
00:53:48.260 - 00:53:49.680

Elise
TC

what was quite long actually was the text
00:53:51.610 - 00:53:55.330

Elise
TC

maybe because we expect something more interactive
00:53:55.330 - 00:53:58.630

Elise
TC

we know that there is sound, that there are images, and things that pass by in parade
00:54:02.610 - 00:54:05.100

Elise
TC

and it is touch sensitive as we have to touch the on-screen buttons
00:54:05.710 - 00:54:07.350

Elise
TC

so we don’t really expect to read
00:54:13.700 - 00:54:16.090

Elise
TC

for reading I personally prefer to use paper guides
00:54:16.090 - 00:54:18.050

Elise
TC

so when I found text I knew I would not really spend time on that
00:54:18.520 - 00:54:20.310

364

Marlene personally I prefer the text
TC
00:54:20.300 - 00:54:21.600
Marlene because, well..
TC
00:54:21.650 - 00:54:22.970
Marlene I can concentrate on that
TC
00:54:23.110 - 00:54:24.430
Marlene while the audio commentaries I could not hear them
TC
00:54:24.600 - 00:54:26.730
Marlene while the texts...if I don’t understand
TC
00:54:27.460 - 00:54:30.440
Marlene I can reread
TC
00:54:33.160 - 00:54:34.810
Marlene it is actually easier for me
TC
00:54:36.580 - 00:54:38.480
moderator and if you had the possibility to personalize the guide
TC
00:54:47.960 - 00:54:50.330
moderator can you see any criteria that could be useful
TC
00:54:59.260 - 00:55:01.990
moderator for personalization ?
TC
00:55:03.010 - 00:55:04.770
……………………….
Johan me, I was expecting something more interactive
TC
00:55:35.170 - 00:55:38.600
Johan
TC

regarding the paintings, while there, once we had captured the painting
00:55:44.750 - 00:55:47.190

Johan our eyes were fixed more on the screen than on the painting
TC
00:55:47.340 - 00:55:50.660
Johan
TC

and then I told myself that I could have as well stayed home in front of my PC
00:55:50.660 - 00:55:53.270

Johan and visit the museum virtually
TC
00:55:53.320 - 00:55:54.680
Johan
TC

it would be the same thing
00:55:54.870 - 00:55:56.510

Marine then to have the computer in between us and the painting
TC
00:56:02.000 - 00:56:04.490
Marine it kind of “cut” things because we were not looking at the painting any more
TC
00:56:04.710 - 00:56:07.280
Marine we felt like being able to place the computer somewhere and just stay in front of the painting
TC
00:56:07.290 - 00:56:09.590
Florence me I did not have at all this impression because
TC
00:56:09.570 - 00:56:11.780

365

Florence thanks to the “description”
TC
00:56:12.330 - 00:56:14.950
Florence when we had the “description” and all this information
TC
00:56:15.630 - 00:56:17.210
Florence I find this exciting, to be able
TC
00:56:17.480 - 00:56:19.610
Florence to hear what the commentaries said
TC
00:56:19.840 - 00:56:22.120
Florence and be able to see the work for real
TC
00:56:22.240 - 00:56:24.260
Florence yes, like “you can see that there” and also be able to see the details and everything
TC
00:56:24.260 - 00:56:26.450
Marine yes in terms of explications (meaning “comments”) you are right,
TC
00:56:29.940 - 00:56:31.680
Marine it is on another level that me I had the impression
TC
00:56:32.040 - 00:56:33.410
Marine that there was...well...
TC
00:56:33.550 - 00:56:34.810
Marine the impression of not being in front of the painting
TC
00:56:34.850 - 00:56:37.240
Simon the fact of having the painting on the screen
TC
00:56:39.310 - 00:56:41.130
Simon me I’d rather have nothing (meaning “not having the painting2 ) on the screen
TC
00:56:44.300 - 00:56:47.360
Simon at least at this moment
TC
00:56:49.550 - 00:56:50.430
Simon like that I would have looked at the painting
TC
00:56:53.070 - 00:56:54.920
Simon while here there were moments where I only looked the guide
TC
00:56:55.040 - 00:56:57.290
Simon and after a while I asked myself why I was looking on the screen
TC
00:56:59.740 - 00:57:02.360
Simon having this thing in between my hands
TC
00:57:03.800 - 00:57:06.390
Simon and the fact that everything came from there
TC
00:57:06.580 - 00:57:08.370
Simon there were moments I just forgot the painting
TC
00:57:08.370 - 00:57:10.950
Simon that was in front of me
TC
00:57:13.100 - 00:57:14.780
moderator Elise, what were your feelings as to this issue?
TC
00:57:14.810 - 00:57:16.910

366

Elise
TC

Personally, I was not blocked on the screen
00:57:16.040 - 00:57:18.200

Elise
TC
