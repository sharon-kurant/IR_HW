Abstract Cultural sites are evolving towards Smart Environments, including the notion of hyper-connected museums. In this context, stakeholders of
cultural assets need more advanced and comprehensive ICT systems for monitoring and modelling visitors behaviors. In this paper we discuss the results
of a longitudinal research study embracing multiple seasons, in a complex
cultural structure including outdoor and indoor attractions, multiple floors
and multiple routes for visitors. Here interactive mobile devices were used for
both offering multi-medial context-aware assistance to visitors and monitoring services to museum stakeholders. We deeply analyzed the data using an
unsupervised classification approach, obtaining a model where the number of
distinct user profiles and the number of features were considered not trivial as well as not too complex for museum stakeholders. We observed that
some optimistic expectations about visitor performances were only partially
met, devising possible explanations in terms of the different user profiles and

Visitors of cultural sites represent a peculiar class of users, which pose multiple challenges for effective behavior modeling: this is becoming more and more
important for both traditional museums and for technologically aided / augmented versions of them. In spite of the widespread availability of any kind
of fixed and mobile devices, a recent survey on international experiences of
museums observatories [1] revealed that systematic data collection is almost
exclusively based on ticketing and questionnaires. These entail many limitations, including small size of samples, reluctance of some people to answering,
difficulties in ensuring proper randomization, time and cost of interviews, and
low frequency of global investigations and analyses (i.e. 2 times per year) [1].
Indeed, such questionnaires include information which can be gathered or inferred, in great part, using technological devices: favourite hours and length of
the visit, activities performed during the visit, preferred information channels
used, types of materials and information contents which were read or listened.
For this purpose, non-invasive systems exploit devices which can track the
presence and movements of visitors without any form of pre-registration or
explicit provisioning of devices for identification and interaction. As an alternative, interactive systems offer multiple types of sensory experiences and
services to the users, using devices which also monitor and save information on
user positions, actions and timings. Each kind of system has its own specific
merits and limitations, while both allow for continuous, massive, automated
gathering and monitoring of evidences, as well as for very frequent analysis
(even real-time) and longitudinal studies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive user modeling method which can embrace non-invasive, interactive,
and even mixed scenarios, where information gathered from multiple types of
passive and interactive devices can be combined. We experimented this method
in a cultural site representing multiple options, opportunities and complexity
factors which can influence and shape user behaviours: these include structural
complexity (number of floors, rooms, open and closed spaces, different routes
and means for physical movements such as scales or lift), richness /diversity
of cultural attractions, and technological sophistication of the multi-medial
interactive devices offered to the visitors. At the same time, we strove for
a model which could be easy to understand and use by museum stakeholders and, more in general, promoters of cultural heritage resources, in order
to support decisions and check the effectiveness of initiatives geared towards
the improvement of user engagement and the evolution of cultural offerings.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses a summary

Traditionally visitor studies in museum have been conducted to analyze visitors behaviour and their spatial use, based on the interview and observation
at most cases [16]. They largely rely on the paper-and-pencil method, ”timing and tracking” [18]. The collected information is mapped and examined to
make a basic knowledge for the management (e.g., the number of visitors, their
visiting patterns), including to measure attracting power, where attracts the
visitors and holding power, which is the length of time spent looking. Based on
manually collected relatively small-scale samples, it was proposed to classify
the visiting style of visitors [17, 22, 24] . The recently appearing emerging technologies revolutionized the way of collecting the behavioral data in museums
and enables us to collect more finer granular space and time resolution [19].
They are, for example, RFIDs [32] , Bluetooth [26], or the combination of other
wearable devices (for example, see [20]). The collected data are used to classify visitors into the pre-established visiting types (i.e., the busy, selective and
greedy) by their path and length of stops [29], to predict the estimated viewing times and the exhibited place to be interested for a visitor, based on their
previous location and viewed time [30], and to validate the previously made
classifications by the quantitative data [31, 36]. They also enable us to compare
mathematical simulations of visit styles [36] with the impacts of multi-medial
location-aware guides, showing that visitors using such guides on their mobile
devices tend to extend the duration of their visits, while reducing the social
interactions among members of the same visitor group [35]. In this perspective,
authors in [23] propose an interesting study on how visitors distribute their
time across artworks in a real case study (the CoBrA Museum of Modem Art);
the limited number of considered volunteered visitors (180) limits the overall
considerations and results they propose. However, the gathered datasets have
often been still small-scale samples rather than longitudinal neither dynamic
nor fine grained. [26, 14] collected the large-scale sample in the large-scale art
museum (i.e., Louvre museum), showing the underlying patterns of visitors’
behaviors in terms of the path sequence and their length of stay in the museum,
but they did not classify the visiting style in terms of visitors’ attributions nor
apply the clustering approach for that purpose.
At the tecnological level, in the last years a handful of different types of devices were experimented for detecting and tracking presence, flows and other
behaviours of visitors, including RFIDs, videocameas, sensors placed at entry
and exit points of rooms, microphones, personal mobile devices, smart glasses
and other wearable devices [33]. This made it possible to compare mathemat-

tend to extend the duration of their visits, while reducing the social interactions among members of the same visitor group [35]. Furthermore, authors in
[21] discuss a theoretical approach and methodology to eye-tracking research
and museum interactive learning experiences. Particularly promising appear
the non-invasive systems, which detect and follow the Media-Access-Control
(MAC) addresses of personal Wi-Fi and /or Bluetooth devices commonly used
by visitors, including smartphones, earphones, smart swatches, bracelets and
similar electronic tags [34, 14]. This paper proposes an unsupervised clustering
approach to the large-scale dataset of visitors’ behaviours in a complex museum environment. In the rest of the paper we will show the feasibility of the
proposed classification approach for visitors’ visiting styles.

3 Data Collection and Modelling
In our experiments, we monitored a museum located inside a castle named Castel Nuovo (also known as Maschio Angioino), where artworks are distributed
into multiple rooms at multiple levels or floors (see Fig. 1).
From the Courtyard, visitors can reach the first floor by either climbing the
stairs or taking the lift, which also provides access to the upper floors. Each

bubble represents an artwork (or group of artworks) for which our smart museum equipment collected statistics: in particular, colour saturation and divergence represent a scale of temperatures proportional to the number of visitors.
The museum environment is equipped with IoT Beacon sensors; each sensor is
placed very close to an artwork (or a group of artworks) and it emits a Bluetooth Low Energy signal. A mobile application named @art, deployed on many
tablets, scans the environment locating the Beacon sensors in its surrounding
area.
Such tablets (see Fig. 2) provide two kind of services in parallel: multi-medial
assistance to visitors in multiple languages, and monitoring for museum stakeholders. The @art app is location-aware, in that it identifies the beacons in its
neighborhoods, and each beacon has a unique identifier and local coordinates,
which are whole numbers relative to the museum map. Based on these coordinates and a proximity algorithm, the APP determines the subset of artworks
which are closer to the visitor. Then a list of artwork icons and names appears
is shown on the tablet screen, and when the visitor selects one item, the APP
proposes a set of item-specific multi-medial resources: the first picture of a
gallery, a short text, and an audio file which starts playing by default. The
user can change the default language, navigate the picture gallery, make the
text invisible or visible, and use the most common commands of audio players,
i.e. stop, restart, and move back and forth the slider of the audio track. Each
visitor may select the same artwork multiple times, either in sequence or by
returning to the same artwork after having selected other ones. The app saves
records of all user actions in a log file, of which Fig. 3 provides an excerpt,
while Table 1 provides some details on the artwork-related command codes.
At the beginning of each visit a new log file is issued, while at the end it is
transferred from the tablet to a central file store, where each visit is uniquely
identified by a progressive, anonymous number. For the objectives of our study,
we analyzed only artwork-related commands in the logs (Table 1), calculating
statistics at two basic level of aggregation: single artwork selection event, and
entire visit of each person (Table 2)

three steps: (i) a data value standardization process, (ii) a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [4] and (iii) a k-means clustering algorithm [5]. For what
concern the step (i), in order to achieve a standardization of all potential features in the collected behavioral data (see Table 2), we mapped the values to
fit the interval [0,1] by using a simple formula:
x → x0 =

|x − xmax |
|xmax − xmin |

where xmax and xmin are the maximum and the minimum value of, respectively. Then, regarding the step (ii), we executed the PCA algorithm on these

more than the 10% to the composition of the first Principal Component. Starting from this observation, we considered only those six features as input for

Finally, focusing our attention on the step (iii), we had to consider some key
aspects related the to the possible optimal selection of the k value, as input
for the k-means clustering algorithm. As it is well known, its is still an open
research problem, and the notion of optimal should be re-stated as more suitable or recommended with respect to the research domain, the available data
and the main goals of the Data Analysis. For example, an evaluation function
f(K) was proposed by the authors in [7] to support the selection of the k value;
unfortunately this approach entailed several onerous re-calculations of a set of
equations to find the k value with an optimal evaluation. In our case, the k
selection problem was supported by an extension of the R framework named
NBclust package [8]. This useful package, given the dataset as input, provides
the automated calculation of many indexes used for determining the number
of clusters (the k value) to be selected as input for the k-means algorithm.
In order to exploit these capabilities, and observing the strategy in [7], we considered to balance the cost and benefits of the k selection strategy depending
on the observations level of details; in particular, a dataset with n objects could
be grouped into any number of clusters between 1 and n, which would correspond to the lowest and the highest levels of detail respectively. By specifying
different values of k, it is possible to compare and assess the results in terms
of relationships among features and their variability at the intra-cluster and
extra-cluster levels. Furthermore, by defining xi as the (p-dimensional) vector

matrix can be defined as follows:

(2)

In our case we have selected p = 6, since each object represents an individual
visitor considering the 6 features output of the step (ii), while n is the total
number of visitors stored in the dataset. By using the NBclust package, we
examined many indexes based on the Wq matrix, focusing our attention on
the following ones: TraceW, Hartigan, Duda, P seudo − T 2 and Beale, which
are defined as follows:

Where F stands for a statistical test, in which the statistic has an Fdistribution under the null hypothesis. The criterion consists in verifying
whether an increase ok the k value (i.e. from k-1 to k) entails a significant reduction in the internal deviancy of groups, with relevant distances
among the group centroids. This iterative approach is based on increasing
the values of k. At each iteration it calculates a critical value with a Fisher
distribution having two degrees of freedom F p, (N m − 2)p; the minimum
value of F for which this critical value is greater than a predefined parameter (alphaBeale) determines the recommended value for k. On our case,
we adopted the default parameter value (0.10).

To further assess the k value selection, we also considered the Marriot and Scott
indexes [13], both based on the Sum-of Squares and CrossProducts (SSCP)
matrix. The SSCP matrix consist of dependent variable sum of squares or
variances along the diagonal of the matrix and covariances (cross-products) on
the off-diagonal elements that represent the common variance shared between
two variables [15]. In details, regarding the SSCP matrix, we have:

This approach aims to evaluate up to which extent it is convenient to increase the number of clusters, in terms of decreasing intra-cluster variability and increasing inter-cluster distance. This iterative approach relies on
increasing values of k. At each iteration, it performs a k-means clustering
and calculates the difference between two consecutive values of the marriot
index; when this difference reaches a maximum, the algorithm yields the
recommended value of k.

In previous experimentations we offered a promotional version of the APP,
which anyone could download for free into their own smartphones; in addition, we offered to visitors a limited number of complimentary APP-equipped
tablets. However, these experiences were concentrated in isolated events, such
as an exhibition located in a single floor of a monumental building [3], which
was monitored for a limited time period. Subsequently, various improvements
and simplifications were introduced in the @Art 2.0 version, and we decided
to experiment a systematic / routine offer of APP-equipped tablets at the entrance of a Museum, which visitors could rent paying a small charge in addition
to the museum ticket. Visitors who pay two fees represent the self-selection a
special kind of population, which theoretically should be very motivated and

study, analyzing data collected within a semester (May 16 th - October 31th
2017, a period of time which spans over 3 seasons). The initial number of artworks selected for monitoring was 164, but malfunctions of a beacon during
the months reduced the beacon-monitored artworks to 160. In the following,
visitors who rent and used the tablet are named T visitors, or even visitors

We executed a 5-means algorithm in R including the 6 features chosen with
the PCA, obtaining the numeric cluster profiles shown in Table 4.
In order to facilitate interpretation and understanding of the numbers, we
mapped them to nominal scales with common labels such as low, medium,
high. We had to consider the fact that different features have different density
distributions of values and outliers, so that the same numeric value may appears low in the context of one feature, and high in the context of another, as
can be understood from the examples shown in Table 6.
As the values in Table 4 were obtained by mapping the original values
to the [0,1] interval, in Table 5 we used the % symbol to emphasize that
they represent percentages with respect to the original intervals of values,
which have different orders of magnitudes and ranges for each feature. In
the case of nfloors (with possible original values 1,2,3,4), the value at the
90th percentile equals the standardized maximum (1.0), and it is quite far
from the standardized average (0.60). On the contrary, in the case of elapsed
(originally a continuum of values up to hundreds of minutes), the value at the
90th percentile (0.33) is very far from the standardized maximum (due to a

can say that 0.33 has to be considered low in the context of maxfloors and
nfloors, while it has to be considered high in the context of elapsed. Based on
percentiles and averages, we defined different thresholds for each feature, and
used them to map the numerical values to the labels of a common nominal
scale, as shown in Table 6.
In this table, clusters are sorted by descending order of population, and the

– Moderate visitors (cl.4) perform limited movements in space and limited
T-based interactions with artworks, with average length of stay in the
museum;
– Wanderers (cl.3) tend to extend their physical movements in most or all
floors, performing limited T-based interactions, while spending more or less
the same time of moderate visitors;
– Strongly engaged visitors (cl.1) tend to cover all floors and most artworks,
exploiting in full the tablet functionalities, and devoting much time for
such intense visit;
– Runners (cl.5) tend to cover a respectable number of floors, but only skimming a limited number of artworks, with corresponding limited T-based
interactions
– Strangers (cl.2) seem some sort of outsiders, which behave as if they were
out of place (what am I doing here?); they in fact tend to stay within the
floor(s) at lowest levels of the museum, visiting few artworks in a short
time.
5.3 Insights in Clustering results

A

The populations of clusters reported as percentages in Table 4 are referred
to the total number of visitors in the entire period of monitoring; as our longitudinal study spanned over 5.5 months, we examined how the population
of each cluster is distributed in each month. According to Fig. 5, the overall
number of visits per month is quite variable, while the breakdown into cluster
populations by month in Fig. 6 together with Fig. 7 reveal some regularities.

It is evident that the dominance relationships among cluster populations
in the entire period (see Fig. 6) are generally preserved in each month, except
for a small inversion between two clusters in October. The population of moderates (cl. 4) remains the highest in each month, followed by wanderers (cl. 3),
strongly engaged(cl.1), runners(cl.5) and strangers(cl.2), respecting the same
descending order of clusters in Table 4 until September.
However, as the overall population incurs relevant variations by month,
we studied the stacked histogram in Fig. 7, where cluster populations are
shown as percentages of the monthly totals: this allows to observe that the
percentages of each cluster skip up and down in different months, as well as to
observe that the differences between the relative ratios of cluster populations
have small fluctuations. Only in October the population of strongly engaged
visitors (cl.1) falls below that of runners(cl.5), but the order of magnitude of
the corresponding variations is not relevant with respect to the fluctuations
affecting each cluster in each month, thus an isolated inversion between two
clusters having slight differences in their relative populations can be consid-

ered an occasional phenomenon. As clusters are positioned in a space with 6
dimensions, catching and assessing the relevance of specific aspects in visitor
profiles is not immediate; for this reason, we examined projections onto some
subspaces with few dimensions at a time. For aspects concerning the extent of
physical movements in the museum, Fig. 8 demonstrates that the total number of visits per floor diminishes or remains stable as the floor level increases,
while Fig. 9 reports the distribution of nfloors values in the population of each
cluster.

A

ut

or

ac

ce

It is evident that wanderers(cl.4) tend to visit 2 distinct floors, and they
account for the majority of the total population. The value nfloors=4 occurs
in almost all visitors of cluster 1(strongly engaged), and also in a great part
of cluster 3(wanderers). A minor but still relevant part of the same cluster 3
has nfloors=3, and the same happens for the majority of visitors in cluster 5
(runners) and very few visitors in cluster 1. The elapsed feature of our model
roughly corresponds to the length of stay in other papers, where it is measured
using different types of devices [14]. Investigations in this area include the
possible influence of the museum entry times; for example, it seems reasonable
to guess that visitors who enter in the museum in the early morning have (or
estimate to have) much time to spend, thus expecting to observe higher lengths
of stay than others, as well as higher propensity for tablet-based interactions.
Similar guesses can hold for people initiating their visit just after lunch time,
while people initiating late in the morning, or late in the afternoon are expected
to have lower values in both elapsed and tablet-based interactions. In order to
check such assumptions, we studied the diagrams reported in Fig. 10 and Fig.
11.

In Fig. 10 the x-axis reports Hour1stArtw, which comes from the hour in
the timestamp of the first T-based artwork selection in a visit, while the y-axis
reports the number of visits which started in each hour band, as a percentage
of the total population monitored in the entire period. We observe that there
are up and down fluctuations, with peaks around 11:00 and 16:00, with a local
minimum around lunch time (13:00), while only a minority of people initiated
their visit in the last hour before the museums close time or just at the opening
time. In Fig. 11 we focus on the average elapsed by entry hour, both in terms
of absolute values and as percentage of the grand total average (i.e. the overall
average on the total population in the entire period of monitoring).

It is evident that, starting from h.9:00 , the average elapsed time tends
to diminish as the entry hour increases; the slope is generally smooth, and
becomes steep only when the entry time is within the last hour band. This
pattern is consistent with the results of a previous study conducted at Louvre,
a very complex and outstanding museum [14], where behaviors were detected
using a non-invasive system which monitored the signals emitted by the personal bluetooth devices of the visitors. In that case, it was verified that the
lengths of stay tend to decrease toward the closing hours of the museum; the
earlier a visitor enters the museum, the longer that visitor tends to stay in the
museum, so that the time visitors enter can be used to predict visitors lengths
of stay in the museum. In our case, the interactive multi-medial assistance provided by tablets allowed to check and confirm such kind of results obtained by
non-invasive devices, while providing additional value by distinguishing among
different visitor profiles and many insights on how visitors spend their time.

In Fig. 12, for example, we report a breakdown of the entry hour vs. average
elapsed relationships for each user profile; this reveals that the decrease of
elapsed with entry hour follows different patterns:

– only moderate visitors (cl. 4), which account for the majority of the overall
population, follow a definitely decreasing trend in elapsed since h.10:00;
– strongly engaged visitors (cl. 1) keep their averages within a range of high
values, fluctuating up and down until entry hour 15, with a remarkable
decrease trend only starting from h.16:00 and after;
– runners (cl. 5) and wanderers (cl. 3) follow fluctuating patterns which appear quite similar to that of strongly engaged, but staying within far lower
elapsed ranges, which keep slightly higher than those of moderates; their
elapsed decreases dramatically starting a little later than others (h.17:00);
– strangers (cl. 2) have more erratic fluctuations in elapsed, staying in any
case at the lowest levels.

A

ut
h

or

In addition to the length of stay we studied how visitors spend their time,
by examining the tablet-based interactions with artworks (T-actions). According to the cluster centroids in Table 4, the levels of artwork-related Tinteractivity (nactartw) can be combined with different levels of elapsed time,
depending on the cluster; combinations of high values in both elapsed time
and T-interactivity occur only in visitors of cluster 1 (strongly engaged). At
the same time, we observe that clusters having increasing values of nartw (the
number of distinct artworks selected) also have increasing values of nactartw
(the corresponding number of actions); in particular, cluster 1 includes visitors
having high values in both nartw and nactartw simultaneously. In order to obtain more insights on such behaviors, we performed drill-down to the level of
individual visitors of each cluster. For example, in Fig. 13 each dot represents a

visitor, labelled with a unique numeric identifier, while the colour indicates the
corresponding cluster. This scatter diagram reports how the T-actions/distinct
artworks ratio can vary for different values of distinct artworks; logarithmic
scales are used in both x and y axes, mainly due to the large range of values of
nactartw. The dotted vertical and horizontal lines represent 90th percentiles
of nartw and nactartw respectively, while the sloped black line represents a
statistical trend line.
Here it is evident that, although the spread of values of this ratio remains relevant among individuals, as nartw increases the corresponding nactartw/nartw ratio tends to decrease. In addition, the magnitude of the spread
of values is also different among clusters, and tends to diminish for clusters
with higher levels of engagement, particularly in cluster 1. This means that
strongly engaged visitors, for visiting many more distinct artworks than others, also perform many more T-actions in total, but it is very unlikely that
they perform too many actions related to a single artwork for all the visited
artworks, otherwise this would require either extreme lengths of stay or particularly frenetic activity, which can occur for a few outliers. We remark that,
at the individual visit level, a certain degree of overlap between clusters isn’t
a surprise, since a diagram such Fig. 13 represents a projection onto a 2D
plane from a 6-dimensional space. This is just another way to appreciate that,
although investigating variables in pairs is very useful for highlighting specific
trends and relationships, all or most of the 6 variables identified with the PCA
remain necessary for characterizing visitor profiles. Interesting insights on the

types of activities are provided by nfullaudio, which accounts for the cases
when the visitor let the audio file be played in full by the APP.
We can observe that the length of most audio tracks is comprised between
1 and 2 minutes (see Table 7), while skimming many photos requires very
few seconds; hence, we could expect that high values of the nfullaudio feature
characterize visitors who devote to artworks much more time than other visitors, and their total elapsed time should be higher as well. On the other hand,
some visitors might find audio tracks annoying (and also consider some human
guides boring as well), so that they stop audio although they still spend noticeable time for artworks, observing them visually and /or performing a relevant
number of other types of artwork-related T-actions, such as photo gallery navigation and text reading. For this reason, we studied the combinations of values
of nfullaudio with nactphoto (see Fig. 14).
In Fig. 14, beyond the threshold value of 35 related to the nfullaudio feature, we can observe a wide spread of combinations between the nactphoto and
nfullaudio features, ranging from (nfullaudio low, nactphoto high) to (nfullaudio high, nactphoto low); beyond this threshold, the nfullaudio feature increases with minimal or no increase in nactphoto (bottom-right area of the
diagram), except for some outliers. In very few cases the nactphoto feature
appears dominant with respect to nfullaudio one (high-left area of the dia-

gram), while very high values of both nfullaudio and nactphoto features can
be found almost exclusively within the cluster 1 (strongly engaged visitors).
These observations are consistent with the results obtained from the PCA (see
Fig. 4): although visitors can play high quantities of actions on photos (thus
confirming their interest on this available option), the contribution of the nactphoto feature to the 1st principal component is by far less important than the
nfullaudio and nactartw features, which includes all types of actions related to
artworks (artwork selection, photo and text exploration, audio slider seektrack
/ stop / up). One possible explanation for such results is that artworks don’t
speak, while the primary reason of a visit is seeing or touching them (for blind
persons). Hence, audio files provide a type of experience that artworks cannot
provide at all, while photos play an important but ancillary augmentation of
visual experience. Photo galleries appear scanned in any visitor profile, while
only people having a sufficient level of motivation tend to listen many audio
files in full. This trend can be detected since the first room including a relevant
number of artworks (e.g. Charles V or Picture Gallery at Level1), hence the
nfullaudio feature is one of the most suitable candidates for early predictions
of engagement levels during the visit.

6 Main lessons learned

ce

pt
ed

m

Studying a complex cultural setting for a long period of time was essential to
provide consistent support to the representativeness and reliability of findings,
which can be grouped in three main areas: (i) affordability, meaningfulness
and manageability of the user model, (ii) assumptions about users vs. user
expectations, (iii)comparison and synergies between different systems for data
collection and analysis.

1. Affordability, meaningfulness and manageability of the user model:
In order to obtain relevant and meaningful visitor profiles, adopting an unsupervised approach entails benefits and risks, which are generally difficult
to balance; in particular, this occurs in the case of k-means clustering,
where the problem of selecting optimal values for k is combined to that of
selecting a reasonable set of features having a convenient predictive power.
We mitigated the risks by combining PCA for feature selection with a set
of multiple mathematical indexes, and by applying them to a large data
set collected in a longitudinal study, embracing many consecutive months
of daily observations. We discovered that these indexes converged to the
recommendation of a value for k (5), which also satisfied the human need
for a non-trivial but limited set of visitor profiles, especially for the sake of
museum stakeholders and other related cultural heritage promoters. Even
the number of features (6) appeared not excessive to them, although it was
necessary to carefully map the numeric values provided by R to suitable
nominal scales for making the model easy to understand. In terms of cost,

2. Assumptions about users vs. user expectations:
We checked the qualities of the resulting 5 x 6 visitor profiles matrix at
different levels of detail, comparing common assumptions with many types
of evidences and outcomes provided by this model. A population of people
paying for both the museum ticket and an additional fee for an interactive device raised optimistic expectations about their levels of interest and
performances, while our study demonstrated that these were only partially
met. Although this sample represents the self-selection of visitors who pay
more for having some services, we ascertained relevant diversities of behaviors inside this kind of population; in particular, the features of the
proposed 5 user profiles resulted very useful to qualify and quantify these
diversities, revealing that only one profile has a strong level of engagement
in all aspects of the proposed user experience, as well as profile with very
low performances all aspects. The other intermediate profiles have different
combinations of performances in two or more aspects, which cover direct
interest in artworks, interest in contextual interactions with multi-medial
contents, propensity to ample movements in the physical space (i.e. interfloors), and length of stay in the museum. In the area of multi-medial
assistance, on average, all kinds of multi-medial contents (images, text
and audio files) have respectable frequencies of selection, while only the
propensity for playing artwork-specific audio files results very relevant for
discriminating among user profiles, and it is one of the most suitable candidates to be considered for early predictions on individual behaviors. Apart
from this distinction, the quantity of interactions with the mobile multimedial APP has a very wide range of variability among visitors, as well
as the average quantity of T-actions per single artwork, but these indicators are not directly correlated to the total elapsed time of visit: visitors of
some profiles tend to spend longer times than others without increasing the
quantity of T actions. This extra time without interactions with the APP
could include pure observations of artworks, pauses for other activities, or
slow movements between rooms and floors which are caught by comparing nfloors to elapsed time. The poor-performance profile (strangers) could
be explained by a combination of multiple factors: subjective inconsistencies between what people pay and their willingness to exploit it, inadequate
awareness of the nature of the (smart) museum experience, and insufficient
availability of time. Another hypothesis is the case of a large distance between the expectations of some people about the @art APP and its actual
features: in principle, we cannot exclude that this kind of APP resulted not
particularly exciting also for people of other profiles, producing a certain
impact on their performances.

the proposed system appeared affordable, since it was automated by combining common statistical packages and business intelligence tools, which
are easily available both on desktop and web-cloud (R, MS Power BI).

3. Comparison and synergies between different systems for data collection and analysis:
In order to check the above assumption, it is possible to integrate our system with user questionnaires, while improvements in user performances
could be expected by proposing them more fascinating technologies, such
as augmented reality and holograms in the museum. Even in such perspectives, the results obtained in our study can be used as a reference and
well-defined term of comparison, in order to assess in which areas, and to
which extent improvements will be actually achieved. In this respect, we
observe that our model is suitable for comparisons with results obtained
using different types of data collection and monitoring systems. In particular, we compared our results about the elapsed time of visitors with a
study on the length of stay in a very complex and outstanding museum
(the Louvre), based on the noninvasive monitoring of personal bluetooth
devices of visitors [14]. In particular, we ascertained that the time spent for
interacting with an APP such as @art can influence the absolute values of
the total length of stay, whose range also depends on many characteristics
of the specific museum (size, quantity of attractions, means and routes for
physical movements, etc.), but we found that some patterns are very similar in both scenarios. In particular, our study confirms that the lengths of
stay tend to decrease toward the closing hours of the museum, as well as
that the earlier a visitor enters the museum, the longer that visitor tends
to stay in the museum. On the other hand, the rates of decrease starting
from early entry times towards late entry times are different in the two
studies, and the breakdown of diagrams at cluster level shows that different user profiles have significant differences in multiple aspects: the ranges
of length of stay, the slope of the lines, the presence and magnitude of up
and down fluctuations. This level of detail on elapsed time was obtained
thanks to the functionalities of our interactive APP, which was also indispensable for investigating how visitors spend their time. For the sake of
monitoring, we realized that non-invasive systems and interactive systems
should not be treated as mutually exclusive, but rather used in synergic
ways. A non-invasive system based on widespread personal devices catches
many visitors who dont rent any device offered by the museum, and has no
impact on their behaviors. An interactive system provided by the museum
is conceived for impacting the behaviors of visitors by purpose, but mainly
in terms of quality of experience rather than quantity; it catches visitors
which are attracted by mobile interactive facilities, although the actual motivation and levels of engagement may be very variable among individuals.
A certain area of overlap exists between these two systems, in that an interactive system can check and confirm some types of patterns observed with
a non-invasive system, while providing more insights and added value on
more aspects of visitor behaviors. In the perspective of a multi-technology,
synergic approach, we remark that the proposed 6-dimensional model is
both inclusive and flexible, since it includes the features that can be mon-

We experimented a totally unsupervised approach for obtaining visitor profiles
from a numerous population of visitors in a wide period of time, which is not
influenced by the characteristics of pre-conceived models coming from sociological theories or other qualitative empirical observations. The proposed system
has the capability to identify and quantify a limited but significant number
of different visitor profiles, which can be the targets of distinct strategies and
specific programs for improvement, evolution and promotion of museum experiences. The noticeable variability of some features of individual behaviors,
which we observed also inside each cluster, can also be seen as a source of
opportunities, since it allows to estimate that some individuals within a profile could easily switch to another more performant profile, in response to new
proposals or well focused improvements and evolutions of existing ones. For
such purposes, museum stakeholders can consider different kinds of initiatives:
hosting new types of artistic installations and new kinds of exhibitions at the
museum premises; opening new rooms to visitors; changes in the disposition
of artworks; improvements in the facilities for visitors movements, provision of
internet connectivity, and advances in technological devices for enriching the
visitor knowledge and interactions with artworks. One promising road is the
evolution of APPs for offering more and more personalized recommendation
during the visit. However, the objective should not be to maximize interactions
with all sorts of technological devices for each second of entire visit, otherwise
physical visits to museum premises could be entirely substituted by remote
virtual ones. Should brick and mortar museums continue to exist, technology
must never overwhelm artworks. Future works will be focused on (i) improving
the k selection strategy, (ii) classifying the visitors behaviour considering their
physical movements/path within the space.
