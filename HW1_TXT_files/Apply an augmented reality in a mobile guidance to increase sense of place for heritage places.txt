Abstract
Based on the sense of place theory and the design principles of guidance and interpretation, this study
developed an augmented reality mobile guidance system that used a historical geo-context-embedded
visiting strategy. This tool for heritage guidance and educational activities enhanced visitor sense of place.
This study consisted of 3 visitor groups (i.e., AR-guidance, audio-guidance, and no-guidance) composed of
87 university students. A quasi-experimental design was adopted to evaluate whether augmented reality
guidance more effectively promoted sense of place and learning performance than the other groups. The
1

results indicated that visitors who used AR guidance showed significant learning and sense of place effects.
Interviews were also employed to determine the possible factors that contribute to the formation of sense of
place. Finally, a majority of the visitors who participated in the study demonstrated positive attitudes
toward the use of the AR-guidance system.

Introduction
Application of sense of place and augmented reality in informal learning
Sense of place (SOP) is the combination of feelings of attachment, dependence, concern, identity, and
belonging that people develop regarding a place. Since 1970, SOP has been applied in the fields of
geography (Tuan, 1974; Relph, 1976; Kaltenborn, 1998; Galliano & Leoffler, 1999). SOP is also applicable
in environmental psychology (Altman & Low, 1992; Jorgensen & Stedman, 2001; Nielsen-Pincus, Hall, &
Force, 2010), tourism, and leisure (Williams, Patterson, Roggenbuck, & Watson, 1992; Kyle & Mowen,
2005). The various applications of SOP indicate that SOP helps establish how visitors personally
experience the significance of a location (Kaltenborn, 1998). For informal learning and education (i.e., field
learning and visiting heritage sites), increased SOP enables learners to develop attachment and interest
toward places, which promotes learning motivation (Altman & Low, 1992; Lewicka, 2005). Furthermore,
numerous scholars (Jorgensen & Stedman, 2001; Kyle & Mowen, 2005; Nielsen-Pincus et al., 2010) have
indicated that the SOP concept encompassed visitors’ affections toward and cognitions about a place.
Based on previous studies defining SOP (Jorgensen & Stedman, 2001; Nielsen-Pincus et al., 2010), the
following three constructs for SOP were incorporated in this study: 1) place attachment (PA), 2) place
dependence (PD), and 3) place identity (PI), which represent the affective, behavioral, and cognitive
relationships, respectively, that people develop with places.
In studies on heritage tourism, Prentice, Guerin, and McGugan (1998) indicated that visitors’ affective and
cognitive experiences regarding heritage sites were associated with the quality of the interpretative media
provided for those places. Specifically, interpretations of heritage sites promote the development of PI
(Uzzell, 1996), and interpretive activities at recreation sites enhance SOP formation and encourage the
conservation of local cultural heritage (Stewart, Hayward, & Devlin, 1998). Furthermore, Knudson, Cable,
and Beck (2003) suggested that the aim of interpretation is to assist visitors in developing SOP. Overall,
high-quality historical and geographical guidance and interpretive activities in a place enhance SOP
formation. Since visiting heritage sites is a common informal learning activity, heritage-site visiting
activities designed based on the SOP theory are expected to promote learners’ interest toward heritage sites
and enhance learners’ motivation to learn about such sites.
Researchers have often stressed enhancing the functions of museums, such as designing educational
projects connected to both learners’formal classroom education and informal out-of-school learning,
(Cox-Petersen, Marsh, Kisiel, & Melber, 2003; Dierking, Falk, Rennie, Anderson, & Ellenbogen, 2003).
Technology is currently used extensively in heritage site and museum guidance. Specifically, augmented
reality (AR) is one of the primary technological applications used to assist historical site or museum
guidance activities. AR is the combination of virtual and real objects in a real environment (Azuma, Baillot,
Behringer, Feiner, Julier, & MacIntyre, 2001; Chang, Chang, Hou, Sung, Chao, & Lee, 2014; Zhang, Sung,
Hou, & Chang, 2014). AR is the technology that overlays digital information on objects or places in a real
world for the purpose of enhancing the user experience (Berryman, 2012; Chang et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,
2014). Studies have shown that visitors perceive AR guidance activities as interesting, fun, challenging,
and a method of achieving first-hand experience. Consequently, AR guidance activities may increase
people’s motivation to visit and learn knowledge (Dunleavy, Dede, & Mitchell, 2008; Klopfer & Squire,
2008; Mulloni, Wagner, & Schmalstieg, 2008; Liu, Tan, & Chu, 2009; Priestnall, 2009; Luckin & Stanton
Fraser, 2011; Chang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014).
AR enhances location-based learning because AR helps learners connect historical sites with their prior
knowledge and provides additional new knowledge relevant to the sites. For example, AR enables visitors
to observe and experience comparisons between cultural artifacts that have disappeared and existing
artifacts in a site. This may enhance visitors’ understanding of the history of cultural heritage and increases
the level of immersion (Portalés, Lerma, & Pérez, 2009; McCall, Wetzel, Löschner & Braun, 2011). AR
technology includes information on people and buildings on the site and allows users to switch between
historical periods and observe the different appearances of a city throughout time. This combination of
additional information and actual scenes enhances people’s senses of reality and presence in a certain place.
However, the application of AR in guidance activities demonstrates areas for improvement (Billinghurst et
3

al., 2003; Dunleavy et al., 2008; Wang & Chen, 2009; McCall et al., 2011). To ensure that visitors view the
additional information presented through AR in a specific visual field, the technology is designed to attract
visitor attention. Hence, visitors tend to focus excessively on the content of the AR system and the
additional information in the AR, thereby neglecting the physical surroundings and environment
(Billinghurst et al., 2003; Dunleavy et al., 2008; Wang & Chen, 2009). McCall et al. (2011) contended that
for some visitors, the sense of presence shaped by the AR environment decreases and cannot be preserved
after a guidance activity is completed and vanishes as visitors proceed to their next destination.
Human–computer–context interaction and historical geo-context-embedded visiting

Sung, Chang, Hou and Chen (2010a) indicated that the planning and application of a mobile guide should
accommodate the overall learning context of the guided environment, taking into consideration the visitor,
the visitor’s companions, historical exhibits, and the cultural or social implications of the exhibits. The
interface and content of a mobile guide plays a significant role in effectively increasing participative
behaviors (e.g., visitors pay more attention to exhibits and spend more time at them). The design of the
mobile guide should fully support the interaction between the visitors and these aforementioned aspects,
thus forming a “human–computer–context” interaction (HCCI) (Sung et al., 2010a). This study proposes an
HCCI framework to design a mobile guide for enhancing interactions and stimulate motivation. The HCCI
framework has two features. The first emphasizes that the design and application of the mobile guide
should encompass the situation within a learning environment, including the visitors, the exhibits, and the
cultural or social meanings behind the exhibits (Falk & Dierking, 2000). Secondly, a mobile guide, as a tool
with embedded information, is intended to facilitate a visitor’s interaction with all aspects of the context
about the exhibits. There are two types of interaction. The traditional type is the
visitor–computer interaction, in which visitors may retrieve or save information in the mobile device.
However, the potential for the mobile device to connect the exhibits and learners is minimized if it only
provides a visitor–computer interaction. The other type is the human–computer–context interaction. In this
type of interaction the visitors not only pay attention to the physical features of the exhibits, but also
interact with the historical background or cultural context, which provides a more in-depth visiting
experience (Bain & Ellenbogen, 2002). Therefore, this type of mobile guide not only support the
interaction between visitors and exhibits, but it also reinforces the interaction between the visitors and the
context behind the exhibits (e.g., being aware of historic and social perspectives when viewing the heritage
site).
Situated cognition is the theoretical foundation for mobile guidance systems based on the HCCI framework.
Situated cognition assumes that knowledge and learning are produced through a cognitive learning process
as visitors interact within a given context (i.e., the surrounding social or physical environmental context)
(Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989; Greeno, Collins, & Resnick, 1996). The mobile leaning guidance with
HCCI can enrich visitor experience by increasing their interactions when interpreting cultural or historical
contexts and situational or artistic conceptions of exhibit (Beck & Cable, 2002). In light of this, the
limitation underlying the planning for AR mobile guide activities lies in the inability to balance a visitor’s
attention distribution between the additional information provided by AR and the physical scenes, causing
them to focus their attention on the “human–computer (guide system)” excessively, and to ignore the more
important human-context (exhibition and local context)” in the real environment. In other words, it cannot
induce the HCCI. The design of an AR mobile guide for exhibitions should therefore emphasize the
coupling the information provided through AR and the actual environment (Klopfer & Squire, 2008; Cheng
& Tsai, 2013) ; that is, enhance the interaction between the additional information and the real physical
scenes.
To develop a guidance system that incorporates HCCI for heritage learning, this study adopted a historical
geo-context-embedded visiting (HGCEV) guidance strategy. The first step of HGCEV is to find out the
past geographical and historical information about the heritage site, and then to establish its geographical
and historical context. When visitors visit the heritage site, the context allows them to feel interested in and
interact with the heritage site, and further to establish the interaction among visitors, the heritage site itself,
and the geographical and historical context of the heritage site. This is the purpose of using the HGCEV
strategy to achieve HCCI. The HGCEV strategy may involve the integration of affective experience,
4

conative behavior, and cognitive knowledge of history and geography with guidance regarding heritage
sites. This is accomplished by constructing the historical narratives and local implications of the heritage
sites into the AR system. This accentuates the individuality of different places, immerses and integrates
visitors in the local context, increases visitor interest, improves visitor familiarity with, sense of belonging
to, and identity with the geographical location, and facilitates the active exploration of the significance and
value of heritage places.
These features compensate for the disadvantages of AR guidance application by establishing HCCI
(Dunleavy et al., 2008). Few studies have examined the use of AR as a guidance tool to increase SOP and
learning performance. This study integrates the HGCEV strategy into a mobile AR guidance system to
construct a HCCI guidance model and applies this model to heritage guidance and interpretive activities. In
addition to guidance system development, the experimental objectives of this study are as follows:
1.
Examine the differences in the learning achievement effects for visitors who used the AR
mobile-guidance device, audio guidance, or no assistive guidance during a heritage visit.
2.
Examine and analyze the different effects of the three guidance modes on the three SOP constructs
(PA, PD, and PI) and overall SOP during a heritage visit.
3.
Use interviews to understand the attitudes of visitors toward the three guidance modes and the
possible contributing factors in the formation of the three constructs of SOP (PA, PD, and PI).

System design
The AR guidance system on heritage places was developed by integrating HGCEV strategy which
promotes the PA, PD, and PI constructs of SOP. In investigating these three constructs, qualitative study
with contextual analysis and in-depth interviews was conducted. The purposive sampling method was
applied to conduct interviews with 21 residents (9 women and 12 men) and 18 visitors (9 women and 9
men) to heritage sites in Tamsui District in Taiwan to identify possible factors of SOP constructs. The
factors about PA, PD, and PI are listed in Table 1. For example, for the PA construct, the factors include
place affection and place interest.

To effectively construct the additional information displayed by AR during a guidance activity, it is
presented according to the interpretation principles results shown in Table 1 proposed by Tilden (1977) and
Beck and Cable (2002). For example, the presentation of additional information to promote PA factors was
based on two interpretation principles: 1) ensuring that visitors associate personal characteristics and
experiences with the heritage on site and creating an affective bond between visitors and heritage site; and
2) increasing visitors’ interest and allowing them to experience the joy of understanding a place. The forms
of media used to present the supplemental information are also described in Table 1. For example, in place
affection, films, images, and songs related to past living experiences were used to promote visitor
attachment to the place.
In this study, the mobile carrier hardware used for the AR mobile guidance system was the ASUS Eee Pad
Transformer TF101 (Android 3.2). The streamlined viewport strategy algorithm developed by Zhang, Hou,
and Chang (2012) was employed as the identification method of the AR guidance system. It has the
capacity to load additional information or interpretations regarding historical or geographical contexts
when visitors aim the camera of a tablet computer at a historical site. This enables convenient operation for
the visitors. The proposed system includes the following functions:
1.
Historical site guidance: This function enables visitors to identify the historical site or heritage site
using the device’s camera and to browse or listen to guidance content that corresponds to the
historical site. The Figure. 1a depicts a visitor using the AR system to identify an image of the
historical structure, and the Figure. 1b shows the visitor using the AR system to view and listen to the
information provided by the system after the structure has been identified. Figure 2. shows how
students read the information of AR system about a historical site. The location selected for this study
was the Tamsui District, which is a location in Taiwan that contains numerous historical sites and
heritage sites. The system contains 14 guidance and interpretation locations. The guidance and
interpretation principles and presentation style were developed according to the guidelines presented
in Table 1, and the contents were reviewed and assessed by two experts on the Tamsui historical sites,
both historical site museum curators.
2.
Historical site observation: This function guides visitors in identifying specific parts or areas of the
historical site. The “Zoom in” and “Zoom out” functions of the device interface enable the
observation of specific areas of the historical site and provide detailed interpretive information on the
areas. Figure 3 presents a schematic of how the system guides visitors to employ the zoom-in and
zoom-out functions to view specific areas of the historical site.

Methodology
This study examined the effects that visitor use of AR guidance systems had on overall SOP effects; PA,
PD, and PI effects; and learning achievement effects before and after experimental processing. This study
also investigated the potential factors that contribute to the formation of SOP in visitors and their attitudes
toward using guidance systems.
Participants
The participants in this study were 87 first-year university students of the Department of Tourism and
Leisure from three classes in Taiwan. Among these, 31 were male and 56 were female subjects, and the
average age was 19 years. Participants were grouped via random sampling. Students in experimental group
1 used the AR mobile guidance system (the AR-guidance group; 31 students). Students in experimental
group 2 used audio guidance (the audio-guidance group; 32 students). Students in the control group did not
use any guidance (no-guidance group; 24 students). The difference between the AR-guidance and
audio-guidance groups was that the audio-guidance group was provided with audio guidance only, although
the content was identical to that provided to the AR-guidance group. Conversely, the AR-guidance group
received both visual and audio guidance simultaneously.
Experimental design
The study employed a quasi-experimental design. The independent variable was the guidance mode group
(AR-guidance group, audio-guidance group, and no-guidance group). The dependent variables were
learning achievement, the three SOP constructs (PA, PD, and PI), and overall SOP effect. This study also
employed interviews to understand visitor attitudes toward the guidance system and the factors that
contribute to SOP formation. Participants in experimental groups 1 and 2 used the AR-guidance system and
the audio-guidance system, respectively. They operated the devices independently for 90 minutes by
following the system instructions. Participants without the assisting guidance devices visited the historical
8

sites for 90 minutes.
Prior to the experiment, all participants completed a SOP scale survey and a learning achievement pretest
regarding Tamsui cultural and historical sites (the duration for each test was 15 minutes). Participants in the
experimental groups received additional training in operating the guidance system and were able to adjust
the device appropriately (approximately 15 minutes). This procedure ensured that the effects of technology
barrier factors were removed. Subsequently, the three groups proceeded with their independent visiting
activities (90 minutes for each group). After the tour, all groups were required to take the learning
achievement posttest and complete the SOP scale. Twenty visitors from each group were randomly
sampled for a follow-up interview.

Instruments
Learning achievement test
The learning achievement test was a paper-and-pencil test that was conducted both as a pretest and a
posttest. The purpose was to examine whether participants had increased factual knowledge of the
historical sites and heritage of Tamsui and to determine learning achievement effects after employing
various guidance modes. The test contained 15 multiple-choice questions. A Tamsui historical site and
heritage expert and a university teacher currently teaching courses related to guidance in travel culture
provided opinions and revisions regarding the proposed test questions. The contents of the pretest and
posttest were identical. The same test was used for the pilot test, which was conducted with 50 first-year
university students. The coefficient of the reliability analysis was 0.503 with an internal consistency.
SOP scale survey
This study used the 5-point (1 to 5) SOP scale proposed by Jorgensen and Stedman (2001) to measure each
SOP construct and the overall SOP effects in all participants following historical site and heritage guidance.
These items were modified based on previous research on the measurement items used for the three place
constructs (Jorgensen & Stedman, 2001; Kyle & Mowen, 2005; Nielsen-Pincus et al., 2010). This scale was
piloted with 50 first-year university students, and the reliability coefficients of SOP, PA, PD, and PI were
0.85, 0.712, 0.687, and 0.731, respectively.
Interview questions
Interview opinions and feedback were employed to understand the potential factors that contribute to the
formation of SOP and the system participant attitudes of the various groups after the guidance activity. The
portion of the interview regarding SOP formation factors was designed to understand the affective
experience, conative behavior, and cognitive knowledge that the participants developed during the visiting
activity. In addition, the interview questioned participants regarding the influence that encountering certain
scenarios or conditions had during the activity process, and participant attitudes toward using the system
were also examined. The interview questions included the degree to which the visitors enjoyed the activity
or using the system, whether the activity or system increased their level of interest, and whether
participants increased their knowledge. In addition, questions concerning learning motivation and opinions
regarding the visit were included.

Results
Learning achievement effects analysis
A one-way analysis of covariance (one-way ANCOVA) was performed to compare the posttest scores of
the experimental groups and the control group after the influence of the pretest scores was removed. The
results are presented in Table 2. After the effect of the pretest scores on the posttest scores was removed,
the between-group scores were significantly different (F ＝10.497, p < 0.05). The results of the ANCOVA
9

indicated that after the experimental processing, the different guidance modes had a significant effect on
the learning achievements of the participants, and the learning achievements among the three groups
differed significantly. A pairwise least significant difference (LSD) test was conducted. The results
demonstrated that the posttest scores of the no-guidance and audio-guidance group were not significantly
different (F ＝10.497, p > 0.05) but that the posttest score of the AR-guidance group was significantly
higher than those of the no-guidance group (F ＝10.497, p < 0.05) and the audio-guidance group (F ＝
10.497, p < 0.05). These results indicate that the participants in the AR-guidance group demonstrated
superior learning achievements.

Analysis of the SOP effect
The SOP scale results for the three groups were used to analyze the effects for the three SOP constructs
(PA, PD, and PI) and the overall SOP. A one-way ANCOVA was conducted to examine the differences in
the SOP-scale posttest scores of the three groups after the effect of the SOP pretest scores was removed.
The results of the ANCOVA are presented in Table 3. The results show that guidance mode did not have a
significant influence on PA, and no significant differences between the groups were found (F ＝ 1.622, p
> 0.05). A pairwise LSD test was performed on the PD scores, but no significant difference was found
between the posttest scores of the no-guidance group and the audio-guidance group (F ＝ 3.410, p > 0.05).
However, the posttest scores of the AR-guidance group were significantly higher than those of the
audio-guidance and no-guidance groups (F ＝ 3.410, p < 0.05; F ＝ 3.410, p < 0.05). These results
indicate that the AR-guidance group experienced greater PD effects. In addition, a pairwise LSD test was
performed on the PI scores, but no significant difference was found between the posttest scores of the
no-guidance and audio-guidance groups (F ＝ 4.793, p > 0.05). Nevertheless, the posttest scores of the
AR-guidance group were significantly higher than those of the audio-guidance and no-guidance groups (F
＝ 4.793, p < 0.05; F ＝ 4.793, p < 0.01). These results indicate that the AR-guidance group experienced
a greater PI effect. Finally, a pairwise LSD test was performed on the overall SOP scores, but no significant
differences were found between the posttest scores of the audio-guidance and no-guidance groups (F ＝
4.306, p > 0.05). The posttest scores of the AR-guidance group were significantly higher than those of the
audio-guidance and no-guidance groups (F ＝ 4.306, p < 0.05; F ＝ 4.306, p < 0.05). These results
indicate that the AR-guidance group experienced a greater overall SOP effect.

Analysis of the interview results
According to Table 1, the formation factors of SOP are elements of its three constructs, PA, PD, and PI,
and other nature content. The interviews examined the whether different factors formed SOP, as shown in
Table 4. The interview results were categorized into several contributing factors and then computed (Table
4). For example, 20 visitors from the AR-guidance group were interviewed, 18 indicated that place
uniqueness contributed to their SOP formation. Therefore, place uniqueness has a 90% possibility of
contributing to SOP formation. The results shown in Table 4 suggest that, compared to the audio-guidance
and no-guidance group, more participants in the AR-guidance group indicated “place uniqueness”,
“historical and geographical implications”, and “inspires place identity” as possible contributing factors for
SOP.

To understand the attitudes of visitors in different groups, the interviews were organized and subsequently
analyzed using one-way analysis of variance to obtain independent samples. The results indicated
significant between-group differences regarding attitudes, including the level of enjoyment, interest,
knowledge acquired, and learning motivation (F = 125.659, p=0.000 < 0.05; F = 98.335, p=0.000 < 0.05; F
= 129.408, p=0.000 < 0.05; F = 91.791, p=0.000 < 0.05; Table 5). Multiple comparison analysis and post
hoc comparisons with the LSD test were performed to examine agreement levels for the four attitudes
among visitors from each group. The results showed that visitors in the AR-guidance group exhibited
greater levels of agreement compared with that of the visitors in the audio-guidance and no-guidance
groups (Table 6).

Discussion and conclusions
In the study, the experimental processing of the three groups of visitors using different guidance modes
confirmed that different guidance modes produced varying learning achievements. Among the groups,
participants in the AR-guidance group appeared to learn more than other groups. Moreover, the analysis of
the interviews showed that learning results increased because the majority of the participants in the
AR-guidance group indicated that the guidance system helped them acquire greater knowledge of the
historical sites and increased their learning motivation. The AR-guidance system provided audio
interpretations and integrated supplemental information, including text and images pertaining to the history
and geography of the sites. This mode effectively increases visitors’ knowledge of historical sites, enhances
their motivation to learn, and facilitates interaction among the visitors, the guidance system, and historical
sites (Klopfer & Squire, 2008). It also helps visitors construct a memory of the place. These results confirm
the necessity of human–computer–context interaction (Sung et al., 2010a; Sung, Hou, Liu, & Chang,
2010b). Numerous studies have indicated that AR-assisted teaching tools promote learning performance
(Dunleavy et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). AR encourages users to
participate and constructs a learning environment that integrates supplemental information and reality. In
addition, this learning environment is realistic and innovative and is integrated with supplemental
information (Dunleavy et al., 2008; Klopfer & Squire, 2008; Mulloni et al., 2008; Luckin & Stanton Fraser,
2011). Consistent with the results of previous studies, the system developed in the study showed significant
facilitation effects on the overall learning achievements of the participants.
Regarding the SOP effects, the results of this study indicate that, aside from the PA construct, participants
in the AR-guidance group scored higher on the PD and PI constructs and the overall SOP than the
participants of the audio-guidance and no-guidance groups. Furthermore, the posttest scores between the
audio-guidance group and no-guidance group were not significantly different. Nevertheless, the PA effect
did not differ between the three groups, which seems inconsistent with the findings of Altman & Low
(1992) and Lewicka (2005). In those studies, PA was enhanced with increases in knowledge about a city’s
past. However, the PA conceptualized in these two studies was a compound concept that incorporated the
PA and PI constructs described in the study. The findings of the study concur with the results of Altman &
Low (1992) and Lewicka (2005) when the increased PI construct effect determined in this study is
considered. This study has determined that the students of AR-guidance group using AR system designed
based on the HGCEV strategy experienced a greater PD and PI. Students are likely to focus and acquire
additional knowledge about a place when they perceive the site as being unique or when they develop
increased site attachment and identification. This promotes learning motivation and positively influences
learning achievements. The analysis of learning effects performed in this study revealed that the learning
achievement effects were superior in students in the AR-guidance group than in students in the other
groups.
Regarding factors that contribute to SOP formation, 100% of the participants in the AR-guidance group
responded positively regarding place affection and place interest. Most (90%) of the visitors in the
AR-guidance group stated that Tamsui was unique and irreplaceable. Moreover, 95% of visitors were
willing to engage in active exploration. The AR-guidance group expressed more significantly positive
responses than the audio-guidance and no-guidance groups.
In summary, this study found that AR enhanced learner SOP and learning achievements (including learning
motivation and learning achievements in knowledge of local history), and effectively improved learning
achievements when applied in learning related to heritage sites. This tool can therefore be applied to
enhance learning achievements. These findings are consistent with those of numerous previous studies that
applied AR to improve learning achievements (Ibáñez et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Dunleavy et al., 2008;
Liu et al., 2009; Martín-Gutiérrez et al., 2010).
Other issues that warrant consideration include ergonomic or human-factor concerns, including the
sensitivity of AR to light, camera angles of the portable, handheld devices. These challenges must be
overcome in the future development of mobile AR application devices. Furthermore, this study identified a
crucial effect of AR-guidance during visits: when focusing on historical site interpretations during outdoor
activities, visitors were susceptible to distractions from external objects and engaged in fewer discussions
13

and interactions about the historical sites with their companions. Consequently, the system tested in this
study limited interpersonal interactions during visits to historical and heritage sites. Therefore,
incorporating a systemic, planned question and answer strategy and other learning strategies into future AR
guidance and integrating appropriate cooperative learning, situated tasks (Bruner, 1985; Sánchez &
Olivares, 2011) is suggested to encourage interactions among visitors and ensure peer–computer–context
interaction (Sung et al., 2010a; Sung et al., 2010b).
Future studies may continue to apply and extend the HGCEV strategy in AR-guidance systems to improve
learning and SOP effects. Additional interactive strategies (e.g., games and role-playing) can be
incorporated to enhance the first-hand experiences and interactions of users.
