Francesca  Raffi  holds  a  PhD  in  audiovisual  translation  and  is  currently  lecturer  in  English 
language and translation at the University of Macerata, Italy. She was a research team member of 
the  Full  Access  to  Cultural  Spaces  (FACS)  project  at  the  University  of  Macerata,  and  she  is 
currently a member of the INRESET (Interdisciplinary Research with Eye-Tracking Technology)
research  team  (University  of  Macerata).  Her  main  research  interests  include  audiovisual 
translation (mainly from a diachronic and historical perspective) and accessibility to media, arts 
and culture.

Abstract
The  present  paper  aims  to  present  significant results  stemming  from  the  FACS  (Full  Access  to 
Cultural Spaces) project, launched in 2014 by the University of Macerata and concluded in 2016. 
In particular, this paper reports on stages one and two of the FACS project which aimed first to 
explore the state of the art of universal access services across a large variety of museums in Italy 
and nine other EU countries. Based on the first stage, an analysis of some of the most significant 
data obtained from a questionnaire sent out to over 1,200 European museums will be presented, 
with  a  special  focus  on  multilingual  devices  and  access  services  for  the  sensory  impaired.  The
first stage was followed by an eye-tracking study on an Italian museum, Turin’s Museo Nazionale 
del Cinema (National Cinema Museum), aimed at evaluating visitors’ experience, attitudes and 
patterns of fruition through a test with a portable eye tracker (Tobii Pro Glasses 2, 50 Hz). Based 
on this  second  stage,  the  fruition  of  information panels  by  museum  visitors  at  the  Museo 
Nazionale del Cinema will be explored, specifically focusing on reading patterns and behaviours.

1. Introduction 

The number  of  museums  around  the  world has increased from 22,000 in  1975 to 55,000 today 

(UNESCO 2017).1 While physical accessibility to cultural heritage is a paramount concern, there 

is an increased awareness that museums carry not only an educational responsibility but also an 

ethical  one  to  create  spaces  geared  towards  the  needs  of  all  audiences,  thus  overcoming  social 

exclusion and promoting universally accessible culture. 

Several guidelines and protocols have been issued to guide museums in achieving the goal of 

 

18 

universal  accessibility,  such  as  Article  30  of  the  United  Nations’  Convention  on  the  Rights  of 

Persons with Disabilities (2007). Moreover, a number of organizations and institutions have led 

the field in raising awareness of this challenge and suggesting best practices at both European and 

international levels. As such, a number of museums were asked to meet the needs of their visitors 

(Komarac, 2014) and improve visitor experiences (Kawashima, 1999).

In light of the above, the present paper aims to present some significant results stemming from 

the  FACS  (Full  Access  to  Cultural  Spaces)  project,  launched  in  2014  by  the  University  of 

Macerata  and  concluded  in  2016.  Originating  out  of  collaboration  among  researchers  in 

audiovisual  translation,  psychology,  museology,  IT  and  usability,2 the  project  aimed  first  to 

explore the state of the art of universal access services across a large variety of museums in Italy 

and nine other EU countries. This first stage was then followed by  an eye-tracking study on an 

Italian  museum,  Turin’s  Museo  Nazionale  del  Cinema  (National  Cinema  Museum),  aimed  at 

evaluating visitors’ experience, attitudes and patterns of fruition through a test with a portable eye 

tracker  (Tobii  Pro  Glasses  2,  50  Hz),  and  a  brief  final  survey.  Finally,  the  analyses  stemming 

from the first stage and the data from the eye-tracking test were joined, in an attempt to draw up a 

comprehensive model for universal accessibility to museums and cultural spaces, to be tested on

more museums across Europe.

In particular, this paper reports on stages one and two of the FACS project. Based on the first 

stage, an analysis of some of the most significant data obtained from a questionnaire sent out to 

over  1,200  European  museums will  be  presented,  with  a  special  focus  on  multilingual  devices 

and  access  services  for  the  sensory  impaired.  An  overview  of  the  access  services  available  in 

museums for each country as well as for the whole sample will also be provided.

Based on the second stage, the fruition of information panels by museum visitors at the Museo 

Nazionale del Cinema will be explored, focusing on reading patterns and behaviours. 

Before moving on to the studies conducted in phases one and two, in the following section the 

concept of accessibility that the FACS project embraces, in line with the principles of universal 

design, will be discussed, together with the motivations for the integration of mobile eye-tracking 

(MET) technology. 

2. Accessibility for all and the FACS project

 

19 

Defining  accessibility  is  an  ongoing and  constantly  changing  process,  both  across  time  and 

societies  (Ryhl, 2009).  In  the  past,  the  accessibility  framework  focused  on  physiology  (Ryhl, 

2016, p. 118)  and  was  mainly  intended  as  the  removal  of  architectural  or  sensory  barriers  to 

ensure equal access to persons with physical or sensory impairments.

Today,  most  societies  feel  the  impact  of  demographic,  economic,  social  and  technological

transformations  which  are  in  turn  shaping  our  local,  national  and  international  communities. 

Population  ageing,  global  migration  and  rapid  technological  advances,  to  name  but  a  few,  are 

broadening the concept and definition of disability to also include all age-related, technological, 

cultural, social and language-related issues.

Therefore,  the  term  accessibility  can  now  be  defined  as  the  degree  to  which  a  product,  a 

service device or environment is available to everyone, to the greatest extent possible, including

(but not exclusively) people with physical, sensory or cognitive disabilities. Therefore, this new 

definition suggests that the concept of accessibility should be intended in its broadest sense, and 

combined with those of inclusion (i.e. participation) and universality (i.e. equality).

In  line  with  the  universal  design  principles,  that  is  “a  process  that  enables  and  empowers  a 

diverse  population  by  improving  human  performance,  health  and  wellness,  and  social 

participation” (Steinfeld, Maisel, 2012), the expression universal accessibility has been coined to 

describe  “the  nature  of  a  product,  process,  service,  environment  or  means  of  access  to 

information  which,  in  an  inclusive  view,  allows  all  users,  including  those  that  may  have  (or 

experience)  limitations,  to  obtain  by  themselves  equivalent  results  in  activities”  (Rocque et  al.,

2015, p. 175).

As  a  consequence,  the  old  homogeneous  concept  of  accessibility,  which  only  addressed  the 

needs  of  certain  categories  of  the  population  with  some  kind  of  physical,  sensory  or  cognitive 

impairment,  has  evolved  into  a  more  heterogeneous  concept  which  has  been  embraced  by 

scholars theorizing on how the right to accessibility should be intended today (Greco, 2016). In 

this sense, the field of media accessibility has proven to be very fruitful, emphasizing and further 

expanding in many directions the question of accessibility for all (Díaz Cintas, 2005; Díaz Cintas, 

Orero, Remael, 2007, pp. 11-20; Mangiron, Orero, O’Hagan, 2014, among others).

As for the field of cultural heritage, Davidson, Heald and Hein (1991) focused on the need for 

and  benefits  of  extending  accessibility  to  the  entire  museum  public  at  the  Boston  Museum  of 

Science,  in  order  to  make  both  the  environment  and  the  content  more  available  to  all  visitors,

 

20 

including (but not exclusively) to those with disabilities. Ang (2005) made a further step towards 

the omni-comprehensive concept of museum accessibility, trying to overcome class and cultural 

hierarchies at the Art Gallery of New South Wales (Sydney) and to engage cultural diversity in 

the art museum.

As  for  technological  tools  applied  to  museum  accessibility,  Ruiz  et  al.  (2010)  adopt  a 

Multimedia Guides for All approach to facilitate universal access to museums via multimedia and 

portable  guides,  making access  available  to  all,  independent  of  their  sensory  disabilities  or 

technological competency. Along the same lines, Hurtado et al. (2012) propose the development 

of a multimedia guide prototype for Granada’s Parque de las Ciencias (Science Park Museum)

based  on  a  combination  of  translation  and  interpreting  modalities  to  improve  museum 

accessibility for all. Álvarez de Morales Mercado and Hurtado (2016) strengthen the interrelation 

between  translation  and  accessibility  while  Sørmoen,  Arenghi  and  Garofalo (2016)  further 

develop the  issues  related  to  participation  by  everyone  in  the  enjoyment  of  cultural  heritage, 

conceiving accessibility as a key strategy for building a truly inclusive society.

Therefore, in keeping with the principles of universal design and following the path traced by 

the  above-mentioned  contributions,  in  2014  the  University  of  Macerata  (Italy)  launched  a  two-

year  project,  FACS  (Full  Access  to  Cultural  Spaces).  The  aim  was  to  address  the  question of 

accessibility to museums and exhibitions focusing on all variables in the provision of appropriate, 

innovative access services: from the technologies used to their effective usability, from the texts 

designed for access to their appropriate reception by diverse categories of the population.

The  project,  founded  on  a  full  integration  of  competences,  knowledge,  and  experiences, 

comprised two different but interrelated steps. First, practices and experiences of 128 museums in 

Italy and 9 other EU countries were examined in order to map the state of the art in the field of 

museum access services, at the time the FACS project was launched.

Bringing  together  the  results  from  the  previous  stage,  in  2015-2016  an  important  Italian 

museum, the Museo Nazionale del Cinema (National Cinema Museum, Turin), which agreed to 

support the project throughout and collaborated as an active case study, was explored in order to 

study the museum visit experience, evaluate the accessibility services provided, as well as their 

possible simplification and standardization.

Even though many studies have been conducted over the years to understand the whole visitor 

and  visit  experience  in  cultural  heritage  settings  (Falk, 2009),  little  research  has  been  done  to 

 

21 

monitor,  analyse  and  use  eye  gaze  for  inferring  user  interests  in  mobile  scenarios  (Mokatren, 

Kuflik, 2016). This is the case of the cultural heritage domain, which forces users to split their 

attention  between  several  tasks  at  the  same  time:  gathering  information,  paying  attention  to 

objects exhibited, interacting with available tools, accessing the services provided, among other 

things.

In light of  the above,  mobile  eye-tracking (MET) technology was integrated  into  the  second 

phase  of  our  project  in  order  to  monitor  and  analyse  users’  visit  experience  at  the  Museo 

Nazionale del Cinema, thus trying to investigate the correlations between the observed patterns, 

meanings  and the  goals of attention (Holmqvist et  al., 2011) to possibly  draft a  comprehensive 

model for a strong, integrated and universal museum accessibility.

Finally,  data  derived  from  step  one  and  step  two  was  combined  in  order  to  draft  a 

comprehensive,  integrated  model  for  true,  technologically based,  easy-to-use  accessibility  for 

museums, to be perfected and possibly further developed through larger-scale studies.

In the following sections, the first and second phase of our project will be presented and some 

of  the major  results  achieved  will  be  discussed,  thus  offering  a  tentative  picture  of  the  main 

access  services  available  in  Europe  (see  Section  3)  and  of  how  these  resources  are  actually 

accessed by museum visitors (see Section 4).

3. The FACS Project: Mapping museum access services in Europe (Stage One)

Following the categorization proposed by Hurtado (2012), museum accessibility can be divided 

into two main areas: accessibility to the museum’s physical environment; and accessibility to the 

museum’s contents. The first step of the FACS project focused on the latter, namely accessibility 

resources  that  museums  provide  to  visitors,  thus  adapting  their  contents  to  different  types  of 

If inclusion and universal design constitute the main reference framework for this project (see 

Section 2), its pioneering nature made it possible to focus mainly on access services for certain 

categories  of  the  population.  Therefore,  besides  the  traditional  portable  guides  and  information

panels  for  different  languages,  it  will  evaluate  the  effective  implementation  by  European 

museums  of  more  contemporary  tools  such  as  tagging  systems  for  mobile  phones,  tablet-

supported  multifunctional  guides,  specific  materials  for  the  visually,  hearing,  and  cognitive 

22 

users.

 

impaired as well as access services designed for children.

3.1 Study design

According  to  the  Abridged  List  of  Key  Museum  Indicators  (EGMUS, 2012),  we  can  count 

around  20,000  medium  and  large museums  in  Europe.  As  a  consequence,  considering  that  the 

size of the population was too large to attempt to survey all of its members, we randomly selected 

125  museums  in  10 European  countries  (Italy,  Spain,  France,  Germany,  Poland,  Greece, 

Portugal, Sweden, Belgium and the UK). Therefore, our results and preliminary conclusions do 

not intend to make any generalizations. Still, we can provide a rich and detailed picture of some 

trends which could be detected at the European level, as far as our sample is concerned.

We  invited  participants  to  answer  a  questionnaire  composed  of  34  questions,  divided  into 

seven  different  groups:  demographics  information;  multilingual  access  services;  access  for  the 

visually impaired; access for the hearing impaired; access for people with cognitive impairment; 

access for children/young; and future projects (i.e. access services to be implemented in the near 

future).

and Spanish).

From March to December 2014, we sent more than 1,200 questionnaires using Lime Survey 

(2003), a free and open source online survey application, together with a cover letter presenting 

the study and providing simple instructions, available in four languages (Italian, English, French 

In  the  following  sections,  the  key  findings  for  each  of  the  access  service  sections  will  be 

discussed.  In  particular,  we  will  focus  on  multilingual  access  services,  access  services  for  the 

visually impaired, and access services for the hearing impaired.

For each category, participants were provided with a close-ended question listing all options 

available, from which they could choose all that applied; if no options applied, participants could 

freely add further options. Interestingly enough, this resulted in being particularly useful for the 

visually  impaired  and  hearing  impaired  groups  of  questions,  as  will  be  shown  in  the  following 

sections.

3.2 Key findings

 

23 

We received  128  answers  from  all  the  selected  countries,  and  more precisely:  29%  Italy;  23% 

Greece;  18%  Spain;  13%  Poland;  12%  Sweden;  11%  Portugal;  10%  Germany;  9%  France  and 

UK, respectively; and 5% Belgium.

It was agreed that the sample should be heterogeneous with regard to museum types in order 

to provide a picture which was as comprehensive as possible. As for the predominant collections, 

among  the  more  than  40  different  museum  typologies  gathered,  archaeological  (15%),  history 

(10%), science/technology (11%), and military/war museums (7%) are the most represented (see 

Table 1).

Table 1 Museum typologies

In  terms  of  size,  our  sample  included  small, medium and  large sized  museums, with  different 

numbers of  visitors  during  the  2012–2014  two-year  period,  as  well  as  museums  based  in  both 

well-known cultural districts  and in  smaller  geographical areas: from Casa Leopardi located in 

Recanati,  a  small  village  in  the  Marche  region,  to  the  Picasso  Museum  in  Barcelona;  from  the 

Übersee-Museum Bremen to London’s British Museum.

As  for  the  section  “Multilingual  Access”,  we  asked  what  kind  of  service(s)  museums  were 

offering their visitors. As shown in Table 2 below, almost 80% of museums reported that printed 

materials  still  represented  the  major  resources  provided  (print  guides/brochures/leaflets),

Table 2 Multilingual access service(s) for our European sample

Along  with  the  more  traditional  portable  audio guides  (33%),  it  seemed  that  technologically 

advanced  solutions  were  timidly  gaining  ground,  with  downloadable  guides  for  use  on 

smartphones and/or tablets (13%), tagging systems (8%), and finally guides available on tablets 

As shown in Table 3 below, while print materials were the preferred solution for all countries 

included in our study, with the highest percentages in France and Belgium, where all museums 

selected  this  option,  the  majority  of  European  museums  seemed  to  be  reluctant  to  provide 

multilingual access services through technological devices.

As far as technology is concerned, significant percentages were observed only in France, which 

seemed to provide a larger and more varied range of technologically advanced services. Finally, 

Google glasses or similar tools seemed to be completely ignored by European museums.

Consequently,  they  autonomously  indicated  further  alternatives,  and  it  was  found  that  specific 

sessions  led  the  way,  with  “workshops”  as  the  most  frequent  option  provided  (15%),  which 

clearly falls out of universal design and the “for all” inclusive policies.

However,  as  shown  in  Table  4 above,  printed  resources  seemed  to  occupy  again  a  primary 

position in the range of museum access services, in particular tactile  materials  (23%)  and large 

print  on  guides/brochures/leaflets  and/or  panels/posters  (18%).  Quite  unpredictably,  audio 

resources  did  not  record significant  percentages,  with  portable  audio guides  and  audio 

descriptions accounting  for less than 20% of  all  available options.  As for  more technologically 

advanced services, downloadable audio guides for use on smartphones and/or tablets and guided 

tours on tablets only accounted for less than 5%. 

As shown in Table 5 below, print materials were the preferred access services offered by the 

majority of European museums participating in the study.

Table 5 Access service(s) for the visually impaired for each European country

Despite  the  success  of  print  materials,  large  print  on  guides/brochures/leaflets  and/or 

panels/posters seemed to be totally  absent from museums in Belgium and in the UK which, on 

the  other  hand,  seemed  to  largely  rely  on  tactile  materials  (25%).  However,  audio  descriptions

were the preferred  option selected by  British  museums  (38%),  which is also  the country  which 

relied more heavily on audio description than any other European country.

Similar  to  what  happened  for  the  previous  section,  European  museums  participating  in  the

study  did  not  select  any  of  the  options  provided  among  the  services  for  the  hearing  impaired 

listed in the questionnaire (see  Table 6 below).  Once again, guided  tours, workshops, activities 

and  special  projects  were  the  most  frequent  options  added  by  respondents,  thus  confirming  the 

tendency  to  create  special and  temporary opportunities  of  inclusion  instead  of  a  permanent

inclusive environment for everyone.

What access service(s) for the hearing impaired does your museum offer to its visitors?

None of the above

Live subtitles/captions on screens

Pre-recorded subtitles/captions on screens

Live sign language interpretation

Downloadable subtitles for use on smartphones and/or tablets

Guided tours on tablets

Pre-recorded sign language interpretation on screens

Table 6 Access service(s) for the hearing impaired for our European sample

Subtitling  seemed  to  lead  the  way,  with  live  subtitles/captions  on  screens  and  pre-recorded 

subtitles/captions  on  screens  as  the  preferred  option,  together  with  live  sign-language 

interpretation  (6%).  As  far  as  technology  is  concerned,  only  3%  of  all  European  museums

and/or  tablets  and  guided  tours  on  tablets. Interestingly  enough,  the  implementation  of  new 

technological tools seems to play a major role in the future agenda of all European museums.

In  the  last  section  of  the  questionnaire,  we  asked  through  two related  open-ended  questions

what new or additional services museums were planning to develop in the following three-year 

period  (2015-2018),  and  for  what  kind  of  visitors.  As  for  the  former,  we  grouped  the  received 

answers according to six macro-categories, as shown in Table 7 below.

Table 7 Additional services for the future

Despite  the  fact  that  until  2014  advanced  technology  seemed  to  have  been  disregarded  by 

European  museums,  the  implementation  of  smartphone/tablet  technology  was  listed  as  the  top 

priority for providing future access services to visitors.

As for the target visitors to which these additional services would be addressed, we find: 30% 

visually  impaired;  20%  hearing  impaired  and  foreigners,  respectively;  9%  children/young;  4% 

disabled (without any reference to the kind of disability); and 2% elderly.

The above-discussed results date back to 2014 and we are not able to say if the situation has 

changed  since  then,  as  far  as  our  sample  of  10 European  countries  is  concerned.  However,  the 

picture  that  can  be  drawn  is  quite  clear,  even  when  taking  into  account  the  above-mentioned 

limitations.

If the concept of accessibility is widespread and present in every modern society, the results 

achieved show that museums have not implemented it in their practice in either a developed or 

committed way. Despite the fact that museums play a clear role as disseminators of all types of

knowledge, our analysis of the situation of European museums also shows that the percentage of 

museums  having  adopted  comprehensive  and  successful  accessibility  plans  in  line  with  the 

principles of universal design is very low.

This  is  hardly  surprising  if  we  consider  that  comprehensive  accessibility  plans  entail 

significant  financial  investment,  as  well  as  a  great  deal  of  work  by  various  professionals  from 

different fields of expertise. In fact, from the data collected, it is clear that paper materials, being 

less expensive, were still the preferred access services provided.

Therefore, starting from this result, in the following section we will investigate how museum 

visitors interact with these materials, thus exploring visitors’ reading patterns and behaviours.

4. The  FACS  Project:  Mapping  museum  experience  at  Turin’s  Museo  del  Cinema (Stage 

Two)

The second stage of the FACS project aimed to evaluate users’ attitudes and patterns of fruition 

at  an  Italian  museum  which  collaborated  as  an  active  case  study,  Turin’s  Museo  Nazionale  del 

Cinema (National  Cinema  Museum).  This  museum  was  selected  not  only  for  its  importance  at 

national and international level but also because its main aim is to provide visitors with different 

stimuli,  so  as  to  reproduce  the  experience  of  being  in  a  cinema  and  watching  a  film. 

Consequently, the museum provides visitors with all the typologies of access services which have 

already  been  mapped  in  Section  3,  from  multilingual  to  tactile  materials,  from  text  panels  to 

audio guides,  thus  perfectly  representing  the  concept  of  accessibility  that  this  project  has

embraced.

We  focused  on  a  permanent  collection  of  the  museum,  specifically,  the  “Archaeology  of 

Cinema”, which is composed of eight sections. These sections are thematically arranged to guide 

visitors  through  the  history  of  cinema  and  offer  rare  collections  which  also  narrate  the 

development of new technologies and new cinematic techniques. For a more accurate evaluation 

of  the  visitor  experience,  we  concentrated  on  only  four  of  these  areas:  Optics,  Peepshows, 

Stereoscopy and Panorama. These four areas are positioned in sequence, one following the other, 

on  the  right  side  of  the  exhibition  room.  The  first  one  “Optics”,  traces  the  history  of  optical 

science, which boomed in the field of cinema in the 17th century. The second one is dedicated to 

“Peepshows”, also called perspective boxes in the UK, an optical device which used lenses and 

 

29 

candles to magnify images. The third one “Stereoscopy”, is dedicated to the stereoscope, which 

was  invented  in  the  19th century  to  create  two-dimensional  images.  The  last  one  “Panorama”, 

offers a  wide-angle  view  or  representation  of  a  physical  space  or  landscape  exhibited  inside  a 

circular building, and dating back to the 18th century. While Optics, Peepshows, Stereoscopy and 

Panorama are placed on the right of the room, on the left there are a few recesses with (mostly 

interactive) objects related to some of the showcases.

Each section includes a showcase with the objects exhibited and distributed on two different 

shelves, one above the other; an information panel including one or two Italian texts divided into 

different  columns,  along  with  their  respective  English  translations;  an  interactive  screen;  and  a 

red  non-interactive  screen  called  “highlight”.  Since  the  main  intention  of  the  museum  was  to 

make  this  collection  as  accessible  as  possible  to  everyone,  a  highlighted  path  (or  simply 

highlights) was introduced for those visitors who do not have enough time to enjoy a full visit but 

who,  at  the  same  time,  do  not  want  to  miss  the  most  important  and  representative  objects 

exhibited in the showcases. 

Figure 1 Highlight path: red screen and highlighted objects in the showcase

As shown in Figure 1 above, the highlighted path is signalled by the red screen, which is intended 

to direct visitors’ attention towards the objects highlighted in red and exhibited in the showcases.

In our study, we discovered that only 12.5% of visitors actually looked at the red screen. Even 

more interestingly, when they looked at the red screen, they did not follow the red line, so they 

did not in fact look  at the objects outlined  in  red. We  also detected that  they mostly interacted

with the red screen in the “wrong” way: they initially thought it was an interactive screen, only to 

be disappointed to learn that it was not, so they simply left it or ignored it completely.

In  the  present  paper,  we  will  focus  on  the  information panel  of  each  section  in  order  to 

investigate how visitors interact with these materials and to try to evaluate visitors’ experience. 

30 

 

Therefore,  we  monitored  eye  gaze  through  Tobii  Pro  Glasses  2,  a  new  generation  eye  tracker 

which enables researchers to infer user interests in mobile scenarios.

4.1 Study design 

Even  if  Tobii  Pro  Glasses  2  enable  researchers  to  analyse  a  dynamic  environment,  for 

quantitative analysis to be meaningful the collected eye-tracking data needs to be analysed using 

fixed objects. Therefore, we first took 42 photos using a digital camera. These would be used as 

snapshots, i.e. still images of objects of interest in the environment under scrutiny.

Bearing  our  objective  in  mind,  we  divided  the  snapshots  into  three  groups,  according  to  the 

objects  included:  showcases  with  objects  exhibited;  showcases,  information panels  and 

interactive/information screens; 

information panels  and 

interactive/informative  screens. 

Snapshots were then imported into a computer running analysis software to be later used for the 

qualitative and quantitative analysis of the collected data.

We then selected our sample of visitors randomly, only excluding those with corrective vision 

devices such  as glasses  and  contact  lenses.  After  providing  visitors  with  all  the  necessary 

information  that  would  help  them  in  deciding  whether  or  not  they  wished  to  take  part  in  the 

experiment, participants were asked to wear the Tobii Pro Glasses (50 Hz) and to simply visit the 

four sections freely, without any further instruction.

Finally,  visitors  were  asked  to  complete  a  questionnaire  at  the  end  of  the  visit  in  order  to 

collect personal information and to establish whether previous experiences in the same or similar 

museums could  have influenced their visit. Data from  the questionnaire  were then qualitatively 

elaborated both to be implemented in our analysis and to more precisely define our sample (age, 

occupation, nationality, previous visits to the museum, etc.).

We collected  a total of  20 participants  but  only  16  provided  usable  video recordings for the 

analysis.  This  was  because  we  had  some  losses  in  terms  of  precision,  during  extreme  eye 

movements,  in  cases  where the  head  unit  moved  slightly  on  the  wearer,  or  in  cases  where the 

participant moved in areas which were too far from the recording unit. Since this could somehow 

negatively  impact  on  the  data  analysis  and  final  results,  we  decided  to  include  only  those 

recordings which provided at least 85% of valid data, reaching a fairly high 88% on average. 

Our final sample was composed of 9 men and 7 women, with ages ranging from 18 to 60 years 

 

31 

old, so a broad sample in terms of age.

4.2 Key findings

As  for  the  first  section,  “Optics”,  6.6%  participants  ignored  the  area  under  scrutiny,  and  the 

average visit duration was one minute and 13 seconds.

Considering the total visit duration,3 visitors dedicated more than 80% of their time interacting 

with  the  informative  area  (i.e. information panel  and  interactive  screen),  and  less  than  20% 

looking at the objects exhibited. In terms of fixation duration,4 around 85% is concentrated on the 

informative  tools,  and  less  than  15%  on the objects exhibited.  Interestingly  enough,  despite the 

interactive  and  more  dynamic  nature  of  the  informative  screen,  it  is  the  information panel, 

comprising  only  an  Italian  text  together  with  its  English  translation,  which  attracted  visitors’ 

attention the most: 67% against 32%, in terms of fixation duration.

As far as the information panel is concerned, the  English  text  was  only  quickly scanned for 

less than 200–250 milliseconds by all visitors, thus resulting in no fixations.

As  for  the  Italian  text,  it  is  made  up  of  20 lines  and  divided  into  two  columns.  A  detailed 

analysis of the way participants read its content shows that users devoted most of the time (total 

fixation duration) to the first column, which averaged 34%, while the second column and the title 

totalled 17%, respectively. 

The  first  column  contains  expressions  such  as  “anamorfosi  catottriche”  (catoptric 

anamorphosis)  and “paradossi  diottrici” (dioptrical paradoxes). All four  words  are  absent from 

Nuovo  Vocabolario  di  Base  della  Lingua  Italiana  De  Mauro  (2016),  which  integrates  high 

frequency vocabulary ranges, thus describing the most used and understood words of the Italian 

language. In addition to that, Dizionario della Lingua Italiana De Mauro (2017, online) labels all 

the above-mentioned terms as technical-specific ones, not belonging to the general language but 

to jargon. Consequently, they are all rather complex to process for the average audience, and this 

is likely to be the reason for the high percentage of fixations on that portion of text.

Interestingly enough, 30% of readers started directly from the second column, thus shortening 

their reading effort by skipping both the title and the first column altogether. In particular, 24% of 

the time was spent on the first four lines and around 5% on the remaining text. Again, in the first 

part  of  the  second  column  we  find  a  complex  sentence  “la  galassia  proteiforme  delle  mirabili 

visioni […]” (The protean galaxy of wondrous visions […]), whose terms are again absent from 

 

32 

Nuovo Vocabolario di Base della Lingua Italiana De Mauro (2016).

Moving  to  the  second  section,  “Peepshows”,  this  section  ranked  first  in  terms  of  time  spent 

visiting it, with an average visit duration of one minute and 37 seconds. However, 13.3% visitors 

ignored it. After carefully examining all video recordings, we can say that the smaller number of 

visitors  is  maybe  due  to  the  fact  that  in  front  of  this  section  participants  found a  mostly 

entertaining  area  called  “Phantasmagoria”,  with various  interactive  tools  which  reproduced  the 

experience of this form of horror theatre.

Going back to the area under scrutiny, considering the total visit duration, visitors dedicated 

more than 65% of their time interacting with the information panel and 32% with the interactive 

screen. The objects exhibited were only quickly scanned for less than 200–250 milliseconds, thus 

resulting in no fixations.

As  far  as  the  information panel  is  concerned,  once  again  no  fixation  was  detected  on  the 

English version. As for the Italian section, which comprises two different texts of nearly 30 lines 

each, visitors focused  mostly  on  the  title  of the first  text and, interestingly  enough, on the first 

column of the second text, entitled “Scatole ottiche per diorami teatrali”.

Participants  reached  this  area  after  visiting  the  previous  section,  “Optics”,  to  the  right. 

Consequently, the first text in front of them is the second text of the information panel, and this 

may explain the higher proportion of fixation for the second text. More specifically, participants 

spent almost 64% of the time on the first section (title and first paragraph), 23% on the following 

paragraph, and 12% on the last one.

Moving to the third section, “Stereoscopy”, all participants visited this section, ranking second 

in  terms  of  time  spent  visiting  it  (one  minute  and  34  seconds). In  particular,  participants  spent 

57%  of  the  overall  time on  the  informative  area  (information panel  and  interactive  screen)  and 

less than 20% looking at the objects exhibited. However, with respect to previous sections, it is 

the interactive screen which proved to be the most popular informative tool.

As  far  as  the  information panel  is  concerned,  it  comprises  two  texts  (together  with  their 

English translation), of nearly 30 lines each. The first text entitled “La Stereoscopia” attracted the 

attention of participants the most. In particular, dividing the text into three main areas of interest 

(two halves of the first column and the entire second column), the first part obtained 58% of the 

total time, the second 29%, and 11% for the third. The text does not describe the objects in the 

showcases but provides visitors with details and information on stereoscopy in general. The only 

 

33 

reference to an object displayed in the showcase, and specifically the stereoscope, can be found in 

the first half of our area of interest, which obtained the highest percentage of fixations (58%).

Once again, no fixation was detected for its English translation. Despite that, the reference to a 

non-Italian  figure,  the  Scottish  inventor  “David  Brewster”,  attracted  the  attention  of  readers

considerably,  registering  a  higher  number  of  fixations,  as  shown  in  the  heat  map5 of  Figure  2

below:

Figure 2 “Stereoscopy”: Heat map

The same pattern, as well as the average reading behaviour, was detected in the following area, 

called  “Panorama”.  More  generally,  13.3%  of  participants  ignored  the  area  under  scrutiny,  and 

the average visit duration was one minute and three seconds. Therefore, it ranks fourth together 

with the “Peepshows” section in terms of number of visitors, and again fourth in terms of time 

spent visiting it.

Even in this section, 92% of the total time was devoted to the informative area, only leaving 

less  than  8%  for  the  objects  exhibited  in  the  showcase. Once  again,  the  information panel 

comprises  two  different  two-column  texts,  of  nearly  30 lines  each,  and  fixations  again 

concentrated at the beginning of the first columns of each text. 

In particular, after analysing the heat maps, we detected a higher concentration of fixations at 

the  beginning  of  column  one  of  the  first  text,  and  precisely  in  correspondence  to  the  French 

expression “La nature à coup d’œil” (nature at a glance), left untranslated for Italian audiences. A 

similar behaviour was found in column three, where the gaze mostly focused on the French word 

“Daguerre”  (referring  to  French  artist  and  photographer  Louis  Daguerre),  and  the  English 

expression  “Portable  Diorama”.  Being  both  foreign  expressions  to  the  Italian  reader,  they 

required more cognitive effort and thus longer fixations. The same mechanism was replicated in 

column  four,  containing  the  foreign  and  very technical  expression  “Polyorama  Panoptique”, 

34 

 

referring to a device based on Daguerre’s Diorama.

5. Conclusions

Museums,  heritage  organizations  and  cultural  spaces  in  general  have  transformed  from  object-

based collections to people-based institutions (Komarac, 2014). Therefore, they are changing to 

ensure that all people, including (but not exclusively) those with disabilities can enjoy the same 

experiences, thus being accessible to all (see Section 2).

Despite this, for many museums, access still means physical access, thus failing to embrace a 

more  heterogeneous  concept  of  accessibility,  which  combines  inclusion  and  universality  (see 

Section  2). Even  if  museums  have  made  progress  in  the  past  decades  in  terms  of  accessibility, 

there is still room for improvement.

The  analysis  carried  out  on our  European  sample  shows that  museums  still  rely  heavily  on 

paper  resources  to  provide  access  services to  their visitors  (print  guides/brochures/leaflets  and 

information panels/posters) and that the implementation of new technologies was listed as the top 

priority for providing future access services.

As for paper materials, these are formats which cannot be printed or downloaded for people to 

adapt them according to their needs, such as changing the font size or converting them using text-

to-speech software. Print or downloadable versions of documents and informative materials are 

not only essential for people with visual, learning, cognitive or physical disabilities (such as co-

ordination  problems,  among  others),  but  also  to  foreign  visitors  who  can  select  the  appropriate 

language to access the information provided. 

As far as language is concerned, visitors may be unfamiliar with the specific terminology used 

in a given field of expertise. Our study at Turin’s Museo Nazionale del Cinema also demonstrated 

that  the  length,  the  layout,  the  use  of  special  language  and  the  number  of  technical  terms  may 

have  a  negative  impact  on  the  way  visitors  experience  the  museum.  The  eye-tracking  study 

showed  that  reading  was  neither  linear  nor  focused,  with  fixations  mainly  concentrated on the 

beginning of each section of the informative texts, and at foreign and technical-specific terms.

The time spent reading depended on the duration of fixations, which in turn increased with the 

increased  cognitive  effort  demanded  by  the  decoding  of  the  words. Furthermore,  as  shown  in 

Section 4, foreign and technical terms in the Italian texts required more cognitive effort (therefore 

longer  fixations).  This,  in  addition  to  the  absence  of  a  “pyramidal” structure  in  which  the 

 

35 

information  is  placed  in  a  hierarchal  order,  did  not  offer  a  clear  reading  path  to  visitors,  thus 

leading visitors to spend much more time on reading than on observing the objects exhibited.

Therefore, simplifying the text, breaking texts down into logical chunks or using bullet points 

may  have  a  positive  impact  on  museum  visits,  enabling  visitors  to  dedicate  their  time  on  the 

exhibition  rather  than  on  decoding  complex  texts. This  would  make  not  only  the  informative 

elements but also the whole visiting experience more widely enjoyable and accessible.

As  a  consequence,  accessibility  may  contribute  to  both  attracting  and  building  long-term 

relationships  with  a  wide  range  of  audiences,  thus  reflecting  the  expectations  of  an  ongoing 

political, social,  environmental and economic context and responding to the  needs of the wider 

community.
