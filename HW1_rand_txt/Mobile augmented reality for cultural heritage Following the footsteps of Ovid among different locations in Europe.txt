Abstract: There are many examples of cultural events that distinguish people nationally. Celebrating
this can bring people closer, as inhabitants of different countries share similar cultural values.
This study investigates a sustainable way to enhance these types of events. On the occasion of
the 2000-year anniversary of the death of the Roman poet Ovid, we propose a mobile augmented
reality (MAR) application that contains historical information related to his life. As Ovid often stated
in his last poems, he feared his work would be forgotten after his exile from Rome. This paper
focuses on assessing whether this is the case, while also disseminating factual, historic data to
people who tested the application. Experiments were conducted in Italy and Romania, in three
different cities: Sulmona, Rome, and Constanta. Based on the results collected, four constructs were
investigated: comprehensibility, manipulability, enjoyment, and usefulness. The results revealed
that the usability of the MAR application, and the interaction metaphor, are appropriate for the
general public. The MAR application provided a positive experience, and thus, increased the extent
of the occasion.

1. Introduction
The development of technology during the last decades has allowed the implementation of
new ways of interacting between people and computers. The progress of digital information has
also significantly affected the evolution of cultural heritage (CH) dissemination [1], offering new
possibilities for developing, e.g., the market of tourist services [2]. Whether it is a mobile application,
an online catalog, or a social media exchange, these new paradigms are affecting all aspects of our
lives, reshaping the way we communicate, learn, and approach the world around us [3]. One of
these technologies that offers new ways of interacting is augmented reality (AR). This technology
has a tremendous potential for the promotion and preservation of CH. People are starting to be
receptive—they want social and collaborative experiences that combine learning with having fun.
CH organizations have to address their needs by creating innovative applications [4], and AR and
mixed reality can make this happen. Computers have become more accessible and cheap enough
for widespread applications in various fields [5]. CH can take advantage of this development by

AR and virtual reality (VR) are technologies that allow us to bring to life lost historical periods
of time, while protecting the real artifacts for generations to come. From this point of view, the main
objective of this research was to introduce mobile augmented reality (MAR) as a means to present CH,
and to sustainably reuse digital content for general public dissemination.
We proposed the corresponding research objectives: to model and design an attractive application
that could be used by tourists and local citizens to learn more about the life of Ovid. To recreate the
historical context of that time by using graphical representations enhanced with audio content. Finally,
to evaluate the effectiveness of that application.
This article is structured as follows: Section 2 describes related work and sets the context of this
paper. Section 3 describes the application and the experiment setup. Section 4 presents the evaluation
results. In Section 5, the findings are summarized and, finally, Section 6 reports conclusions and
future work.
2. Related Work
Preserving cultural heritage provides the reasoning to investigate the opportunities offered by
digital technology. There is a vast body of work within the field of AR in CH contexts, especially for
education, learning, and improving tourist experience [11–17].
From a historical perspective, AR was developed from VR, with the specificity that allows the
visualization of both real and virtual objects at the same time. The first VR system is considered to
be Sensorama machine, developed in the late 1950s [18], while the history of AR started in 1968 with
the head-mounted display system developed by Ivan Sutherland. The term “augmented reality” was
coined only in 1990 by Tom Caudell and David Mizell [19]. With the development of technology
over time, the concept has evolved and the advancements in handheld computers have opened
new opportunities for AR [1]. The first handheld mobile phone was presented by Motorola in 1973,
and the first personal digital assistant (PDA) appeared on the market in the early 90s. Only a few
years later, Bruce H. Thomas developed ARQuake, the first outdoor mobile AR game on PDA [20].
The mobility offered by handheld devices, and the increased progress in terms of software, led to the
spread of AR applications as well as the development of new interfaces and new technologies. In 2014,
Google announced Project Tango, an Android solution for AR that combines three core technologies:
depth perception, motion tracking, and area learning [21].
Since then, stand-alone AR has gradually become more common as computing power on PDAs
and smartphones has increased. AR applications implemented on mobile devices were named mobile
AR, or handheld mobile AR (HMAR). Such a system is, in its basic form, a mobile device with a display
to show an augmentation using the appropriate software [22], with the following characteristics [23]:

•
•
•

it combines real and virtual objects in a real environment;
it is interactive, works in real time;
it registers and aligns real and virtual objects with each other.

There are 2 key issues that need to be considered when developing MAR applications: the accuracy
of user tracking and the registration of 3D models with real-world features [24]. The tracking, or the
estimation of camera position, can be realized in two ways:

•
•

marker-based tracking, which requires labels with a colored or black and white pattern;
marker-less tracking, which uses the mobile device’s GPS or image recognition systems to identify
a location [25].

In the case of a CH application, placing markers in the scene is not practical; thus, marker-less
methods are required for extracting features from the environment. These features are used for correct
alignment of virtual information with real information, a process known as registration. There are two
methods of registration:

Sustainability 2019, 11, 1167

without prior knowledge—the registration is realized ‘on-line’, without any prior
scene knowledge;
with prior knowledge—predefined patterns are taken into account from the environment in order
to identify a match. An overview on the history of tracking for MAR is given in [26].

The surveys on MAR work performed in different application domains [27], or strictly related to
the touristic context [28], highlight some determinants and issues that have impact on the utilization
of this type of application [15]. Although MAR applications were first designed and tested in indoor
environments, the advantage of portability provided by mobile devices facilitated their expansion
to the outdoors. This allowed visualization of 3D models of heritage sites to be superimposed over
the video stream from the outside environment [29], visualizing virtual points of interest (POIs)
overlaid on top of the phone’s camera view [30], or textual annotation of outdoor locations based
on GPS measurements [31]. Reference [32] proposed an application for outdoor site exploration
throughout different periods of time, enriching travel experiences with important historic facts. In other
research papers, the authors have used MAR applications “in situ” so that the visitors were able to
explore and visualize building details in an intuitive way [33], to educate students visiting an outdoor
archaeological site in a game-like approach—“Oracle of Delphi app” [34], or for huge reconstructed
models of heritage monuments (e.g., Roman Theatre of Byblos) [35]. A novel paradigm is proposed
in [36] based on presenting user artwork, in terms of 3D models, videos, and photos, in virtual kiosks
augmented on the camera view of a handheld device.
AR has been introduced in the CH sector over the last decade primarily as a useful technology
for assisting visitors inside museums or in heritage sites [37–39]. It allows visitors to explore and
appreciate the objects showcased by overcoming barriers in time, space, and language [40]. It also
improves the learning experience in CH with the aid of better user interaction methods [24,41].
For instance, in [42] the information is organized in finite triplets (visual representation, context,
and corresponding audiovisual content) in order to be presented in a personalized, interactive manner
on users’ personal mobile devices. Using AR techniques, geomatic resources were also developed,
allowing the valorization of the geological heritage [43]. MAR applications can provide real-time
information based on the user’s preferences and context [44], and can also generate revenue or
economic returns [45]. A thorough review of AR applications for CH is provided in [46].
Moreover, AR technologies have proven their importance in the virtual reconstruction of
historical monuments, having the potential to provide a new approach to the past by reproducing
on-site historical experiences [13]. In the last decade, many objects, monuments, or historical sites
were reconstructed into digital formats. The significance of reconstruction is to preserve, protect,
and interpret culture and history [4], and to bring to life elements from the past [47,48]. According
to [49], every two years the digital heritage is doubling in size and is expected to grow tenfold
between 2013 and 2020. While digital heritage is primarily concerned with preservation of CH, virtual
heritage (VH) involves the synthesis, conservation, reproduction, representation, digital reprocessing,
and display [50] of monuments, artifacts, buildings, and culture, aiming to be more open to global
audiences [11]. CH does not end with objects and collections. It also includes information such as
traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, activities related to nature and the
universe, or skills to produce traditional crafts [51]. According to UNESCO this is the intangible CH,
and in order to be celebrated and contemplated more easily, requires the creation of specific conditions
to ensure its viability when it is materialized in the form of a media resource [2].
However, the development of applications that targets reactivation of CH in local citizens remains
a challenge [52]. In this sense, it is of the utmost importance to take into account the process of
evaluation of digital cultural resources. Digital resources are a combination of cultural resources that
are created using computer and multimedia technologies. They can be accessed and used in digital
form [53].
Given their diversity, evaluation is not a simple process. In this paper we focus only on the
evaluation of MAR applications. These should be carefully designed and improved based on user

Sustainability 2019, 11, 1167

feedback [54]. An important component, which is studied in several papers, is the usability of the
application. Relying on five usability principles developed in [55], and on a compilation of heuristic
evaluation checklists for mobile interfaces proposed in [56], an MAR application was evaluated in [57]
in terms of usability and user expectations. Usability was evaluated in [58] using four different
methods. In [52] a methodological framework was proposed, which allowed developers to categorize
the type of CH application and to determine which resources should be used. Santos designed a
questionnaire for usability evaluation (HARUS), which was composed of two sub-questionnaires,
namely the comprehensibility scale and the manipulability scale [59].
Tourist requirements for the development of mobile AR applications were investigated
in [60], concluding that tourists are increasingly expecting methods to access information instantly.
Other components of experience with AR applications in public were examined in [61], including
designing interface features, augmentation features, and so on. Good results after an evaluation of user
experience in a mobile AR tourist guide, in terms of ease-of-use and intuitiveness, were obtained in [62].
Users’ perceptions and experiences were measured by applying a modified technology acceptance
model (TAM) in [63]. Immersion, seen as a form of cognitive and emotional absorption in AR settings,
was studied in [64].
In conclusion, there are various studies regarding augmented reality applications in the CH
area. Most of them show that the use of new technologies creates innovative and attractive options
that increases the users’ interest in learning more about CH. However, there are just a few that try
to target people from more than one country. Project Tango represents a high-end technology that
provides stable and reliable motion tracking. Based on this technology, we’ve developed an application
and assessed its adoption using a questionnaire adapted from [54] and [65], which characterizes
the following four subjective parameters: perceived comprehensibility, perceived manipulability,
perceived enjoyment, and perceived usefulness. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most
extensive user studies in AR conducted in outdoor environments.
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) Setup
The AR application presented in this paper was developed with the aim of bringing to life specific
moments from Ovid’s life. It was designed for the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro phablet (which incorporates
the Google Tango technology). At the time of the research, this was the only Tango-enabled device
available on the market. Phab 2 Pro used a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, 4 GB of RAM,
and 64 GB storage. It used specialized Tango-related sensors—a fisheye camera that can handle the
motion tracking, and an infrared depth sensor that used the “time-of-flight” principle to corroborate
data with the video stream outputted by the camera [66]. Google Tango incorporates three core
components:
1.

3.

Motion tracking—Tango implements visual–inertial odometry that is used to estimate the
trajectory of the device (i.e., its position in the scene relative to the starting point). The inertial
sensors of the mobile device are used to provide data regarding the acceleration and rotation of
the device.
Area learning—This allows the ability to see and remember certain visual features of a physical
space (edges, corners, unique features). Thus, the device is able to “recognize” the area.
The motion tracking alone can be affected by “drift”, which is caused by the integration of
inertial data. Area learning improves the accuracy of the trajectory (through a process called
“drift correction”) and allows a Tango device to perform “localization” (orient and position itself
when it recognizes a previously learned area).
Depth perception—Tango-enabled devices can understand what is the distance to any object in
the real world. A common use is to obtain point clouds of scanned objects in real time.

The virtual 3D character of Ovid included animations and an audio source to play the poem.
Visitors used the Lenovo phablet to explore the inside and outside of the Roman house, observe the
gestures of Ovid while he recited his own poem, or when he sat at the table writing a poem. If someone
passed by or stood next to the virtual character, the device displayed both that person and Ovid on the
screen, as in real life.
Ovid’s 3D models, as child, adult in Rome, and elder in Tomis, were obtained using MakeHuman,
version 1.1.0 [68] and Blender, version 2.77a (Blender Foundation, Amsterdam, Netherlands) [69],
which are free, open-source software. They were animated using Adobe Mixamo [70]. The characters
were designed based on the historical figure of Ovid. The selected animations corresponded to
activities such as walking, sitting, writing, and idle behaviors. These models were integrated in the
MAR application using Unity software, version 5.2.5 (Unity Technologies, San Francisco, USA) [71].

For the purpose of this study, several locations were selected to perform the experiment.
The reason for choosing these specific places was that we wanted to present the application in
cities where there was a greater possibility that tourists or residents have heard of the poet Ovid.
As mentioned above, the three locations were the following:

•
•
•

Constanta, Romania—In an archeological site of ancient Tomis, near the cathedral of the Apostles
Saint Peter and Saint Paul;
Rome, Italy—At the south part of Piazza de Colosseo, near Colosseum, the famous Roman
amphitheater located in the center of the city;
Sulmona, Italy—A historic town located in the province of L’Aquila in Abruzzo. The experiment
took place in one of the city’s main squares, Piazza XX Settembre, which is adjacent to the main
street, Corso Ovidio, and very close to Piazza Garibaldi.

Not only was the location different, but also the content of the application was slightly different.
For instance, in Constanta the virtual building was placed on top of the ruins of a real ancient Roman
house. By doing so, users had a more realistic experience when navigating inside and outside the
house (Figure 5a). This version of Ovid was reciting a short part of the poem “Sorrows”, in which he
expresses his complaints and fears regarding the place where he was exiled. The animated virtual
model of Ovid writing at a table was located in the last room of the house, and is presented in Figure 5b.
In Rome, the application was similar, except that Ovid could be seen in Roman clothes,
walking through the square (Figure 5c) while reciting a small part of his work The Metamorphoses,
Book I—Fable 1. The Roman poet spent his childhood in Sulmona; as such, we decided to use a child
version of Ovid. In this scenario, Ovid was walking outside the house, while in the background users
could hear a poem recited by a child in an old Italian dialect (Figure 5d).
Therefore, there were three different applications, with different scenarios and audio content
heard in the background. Each application build in Unity contained a scene with one or two characters
and some objects, as follows:

For Sulmona, the scenario featured a Roman house, the child version of Ovid walking in circles
near the house, and a child voice that recited the poem “Metamorphoses”, Fable I in old Italian
language. There were also some objects around the house, such as marble columns or barrels.
The poem can be heard in a loop, and the animation of the child created with Mixamo repeated
itself after 30 s. The time needed to discover the whole MAR scene was roughly 150 s, depending
on the pace of the participants.
For Rome, the application showcased a Roman house with two rooms and different pieces of
furniture. The adult version of Ovid was walking in front of the house in a 15-second animation
loop, and as audio content, the “Metamorphoses” narrative poem was recited by an adult voice.
To discover the entire MAR scene it took around 110 s.
For Constanta, the scene was comprised of a Roman house and two versions of elder Ovid:
one moving around the house and one writing at the table located in the second room of the
house. In the background, users could hear a voice reciting Ovid’s poem “Sorrows”. Around 150 s
were needed to discover the whole MAR scene.

A survey was performed following the same procedure in all locations. Participants that agreed
to take part in the experiment received a verbal introduction about the purpose of the experiment and
a short tutorial regarding the usage of the AR application. They received the Lenovo phablet with the
OvidAR application, after which they were allowed to explore the 3D scene as much as they wanted
(each participant used the app between 4 and 12 min). After the experiment, participants completed a
questionnaire in order to provide feedback on the experience they had using the application.
From the previous literature regarding the evaluation of MAR applications, we adopted four
measurement items: perceived comprehensibility, perceived manipulability [59], perceived enjoyment,
and perceived usefulness [65].

3.4. Participants
Participants included citizens and tourists that showed interest in trying a mobile AR
application. A total of 63 subjects, 37 males and 26 females, aged between 17 and 62 (mean = 33.8, SD
= 11.1) got the opportunity to try the application. Approximately 1/3 of the respondents were between
20 and 29 years old (34.9%), and another 1/3 were between 30 and 39 years old (33.3%). Participants

asked to rate their usage of mobile devices on a Likert-type scale (from 1 = “never use a mobile device”
to 7 = “daily use of mobile devices”) and if they have ever previously used an AR application. Each of
them used a smartphone or tablet almost every day (mean = 5.9, SD = 1.1) and about half of them (32)
had never used or seen an AR application.
Figure 6 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the respondents. Individual
characteristics for each of the places where the application was tested are briefly presented in Table 1.

3.5. Questionnaire Design
The measurement items of the proposed questionnaire (22 in total) are summarized in Table 2
by each construct: perceived comprehensibility (eight items), perceived manipulability (six items),
perceived enjoyment (four items), and perceived usefulness (four items). The participants had absolute
freedom to fill the questionnaire to their own discretion.
The questionnaire was divided into three parts:

•

•

•

The first section intended to collect some individual variables such as age and gender, participants’
degree of familiarity with mobile devices and AR applications, and if they had knowledge of who
Ovid was;
The second section (statements 1 to 14) intended to evaluate the usability of the application using
the handheld augmented reality usability scale (HARUS) [54]. The HARUS questionnaire had
been developed for evaluating the comprehensibility and manipulability of MAR applications.
The HARUS questionnaire contained eight statements for the comprehensibility scale and eight
statements for the manipulability scale, but we decided to remove two of the manipulability
questions (“I found it easy to input information through the application”, “I think the operation of
this application is simple and uncomplicated”) because they were not relevant to the evaluation
of the proposed application;
The last section (statements 15 to 22) aimed to assess the perceived enjoyment and usefulness of
the application. The questions have been extracted from the questionnaires proposed in [65]. QU 3
and QU 4 was added in order to evaluate the feature that allowed users to hear audio content.

All the questions used a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1—“strongly disagree”, to 7—“strongly
agree”. Depending on the time availability, users were asked to fill in the questionnaire on site,
or instead, access a survey link sent to their e-mail to be completed at a later time. Out of the
63 questionnaires collected, 21 were completed online and 2 incomplete questionnaires were eliminated.
A total of 61 questionnaires were used for this study (96.82%).
The online survey questionnaire was developed in English, and the paper-based questionnaire
was translated into Romanian and Italian for participants who had difficulties understanding English.
4. Results
Responses were put together to obtain a value for each of the four constructs defined by the
questionnaire: comprehensibility, manipulability, enjoyment, and usefulness. The questionnaire
contained both positive and negative worded items. For the negatively formulated questions, we first
reversed the results in order to have the same scale. We chose to alternate positive and negative
items. In this way, the user may be more careful when completing the questionnaire, and the answer
was, thus, more relevant for the survey. After that, the scores were converted to a range of 0 to 6.
All the values were then summed, and the sum was mapped to a range of 0 to 100. This method
of data aggregation was done according to the instructions from the original HARUS questionnaire
assessment [54].
Figures A1–A3 from Appendix A show the obtained scores for each of the questions for the three
experiments, represented as box charts. In each figure, mean, median, interquartile values, whiskers,
and outliers were reported.
For validating our measurement model, we evaluated reliability and sampling adequacy.
Reliability was assessed by calculating Cronbach’s α, and the proportion of variance was assessed by
the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index. Each of the measures exceeded the recommended threshold (Cronbach’s
alpha = 0.902, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin = 0.796).
When participants were asked: “Do you have any knowledge of who Ovid is?”, the majority
of them answered “Yes” from all three locations. Results showed that Ovid was known by 95% of
the participants in Sulmona, 91% of the participants from Rome admitted to have heard of Ovid,
while only 73% of the participants in Constanta heard of him. The values obtained for each question
for all the users are displayed in Figure 7.

The values for each construct—comprehensibility (mean = 91.06; SD = 4.46), manipulability

experiments for the manipulability construct: Constanta (mean = 93.16), Rome (mean = 93.65), and
Sulmona (mean = 94.53).

5.2. Manipulability
On perceived manipulability in the survey, QM4 and QM6 items had a median of 6.0 and a mean
over 5.4. The others had a median of 5.0 and a mean between 5.08 and 5.44. While QM4 obtained
the highest score, QM3 had the lowest median. The device was small, and the users did not have
problems related to their arm comfort. Only small difficulties in holding the device while operating

Similar to the comprehensibility construct, very close values were obtained for all the experiments
for the manipulability construct: Constanta (mean = 93.16), Rome (mean = 93.65), and Sulmona (mean
= 94.53).
5.3. Enjoyment
For perceiving enjoyment, only QE3 had a median of 5.0, while the other three items had a
median of 6.0. The mean ranged from 5.13 to 5.68. For this construct we obtained the highest values.
QE1 achieved the highest score from all the questions that were proposed in the survey. The users liked
to use the application. Good results were also obtained for QE3, which indicated that the objective set
at the beginning was met. Only eight participants rated 5 in the Likert-scale for this question, and the
others rated it 6 and 7.
The values obtained for this construct were: Constanta (mean = 94.87), Rome (mean = 96.19),
and Sulmona (mean = 96.88).
5.4. Usefulness
On perceived usefulness, all four items had a median of 5.0 and a mean between 4.84 and
5.12. Item QU1 had the lowest average score. Some users suggested that the application might be
improved with text to better reflect its purpose and to have more historical information about Ovid.
Better scores were obtained for the items related to audio content, i.e., when Ovid’s poem was heard in
the background.
Perceived usefulness achieved the lowest score in the three cases: Constanta (mean = 88.55),
Rome (mean = 86.43), and Sulmona (mean = 85.16).
Usefulness was the area of the survey where the users had the most variable results. The standard
deviation ranged from 0.81 to 0.90. However, the highest value for standard deviation was obtained
for item QM3 (SD = 0.94).
Briefly, we can conclude that participants enjoyed using the application and were mostly satisfied
with its content. Although some historical data were missing, the application was easy to use, it was
useful, and it confirmed the fact that the development of new interfaces for promoting CH is a
sustainable action well-received by the public. Relevant photos and screenshots from the experiments
are presented in Figure 9.
In Figure 9a2 the modelled house of Ovid is presented, placed on the top of the ruins of the real
ancient house from Constanta. Figure 9c represents another modelled house, and the child version of
Ovid walking.
The technology allowed registration of the model in different places accessible to tourists. It took
into account their orientation, and adapted to their viewpoint. A wide variety of tourists can use the
device (Figure 9a1,a3,b).
