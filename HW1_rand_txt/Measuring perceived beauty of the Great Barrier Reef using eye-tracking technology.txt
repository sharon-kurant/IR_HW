ABSTRACT

The purpose of this research is to test the usefulness of eye-tracking in
measuring the perceived beauty of photos of the Great Barrier Reef. Eye-
tracking  is  used  to  measure  visual  attention  (ﬁxation  count,  ﬁxation
duration)  to  21  photos  ranked  in  the  degree  of  perceived  beauty.
Results  indicate  signiﬁcant  diﬀerences  in  visual  attention  to  
‘beautiful’
and   ‘ugly’  photos   and   a   signiﬁcant   correlation   between   average
perceived beauty and attention measures. This study provides evidence
that eye-tracking can be used to measure the relative perceived beauty
of natural images reﬂecting the attention given to ‘attractive’ images.

Introduction

The importance of aesthetic characteristics of a destination is well recognized 
in tourism literature as
natural beauty is one of the key reasons for tourists to visit a place 
(Kirillova, Fu, Lehto, & Cai, 2014;
Todd, 2009; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). The aesthetic qualities of a destination aﬀect 
tourists’ experience in
that place, their satisfaction, loyalty and revisit intentions (Chi & Qu, 2008; 
Lee, Jeon, & Kim, 2011;
O’Leary & Deegan, 2003; Tan & Kuo, 2014). Indeed, tourist perceived beauty of a 
destination plays
a  critical  role  in  destination  choice  process  (Vogt,  Fesenmaier,  &  
MacKay,  1994).  For  example,
UNESCO World Heritage Listed Regions such as the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) 
attracts millions of tour-
ists to North Queensland because of their aesthetic reputation (Johnston, 
Smith, & Dyke, 2013; Packer,
Ballantyne, & Hughes, 2014).

The GBR Marine Park application for listing as a World Heritage Area states 
that it is a region of
‘natural  beauty’  that  ‘contains  superlative  natural  phenomena  or  areas  
of  exceptional  natural
beauty  and  aesthetic  importance’  (Great  Barrier  Reef  Marine  Park  
Authority,  2014,  p.  93).  This
natural  beauty  extends  ‘above  and  below  the  water’ (Great  Barrier  Reef 
 Marine  Park  Authority,
2014, p. 280). However, The Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2014 (Great 
Barrier Reef Marine Park
Authority, 2014, p. 100) indicates the underwater beauty of the GBR is under 
threat due to a reduction
in coral cover and reduced water clarity.

The [GBR] Region generally continues to be an area of great natural beauty; 
however, coastal infrastructure,
marine debris [especially on beaches], reduced water clarity and declining 
coral cover, especially in southern
and central inshore areas, have reduced underwater aesthetic values.

Given the importance of maintaining the natural beauty of places such as the 
GBR, it is somewhat
surprising that there is no agreed approach to evaluating perceived beauty.

made recommendations, but no objective assessment method is as yet available 
(Context Pty Ltd,
2013).  Development  of  an  objective  approach  to  the  measurement  of  
perceived  beauty  would
enable aesthetic assessments to be included into destination management and 
conservation plan-
ning,  allowing  changes  in  the  beauty  of  the  GBR  to  be  monitored  
(Marshall,  Marshall,  &  Smith,
2017). This paper reports on research conducted to develop an objective method 
to monitor the per-
ceived underwater scenic beauty of the GBR.

The method is based on the idea of beauty as a subjective mental evaluation of 
a perceived object
(i.e. a visual scene or picture) (Berlyne, 1973; Lothian, 1999). Individual 
aesthetic evaluations of an
object will diﬀer due to variations in expertise or preferences, but an 
individual’s evaluation of an
object’s beauty is correlated to subconscious visual attention processes and 
the eye-movements
they direct (Calvo & Lang, 2004; Nummenmaa, Hyönä, & Calvo, 2006). Such 
eye-movements can
be  tracked,  and  their  important  characteristics  such  as  ﬁxations  and  
saccades,  measured  using
eye-tracking equipment (Leder, Mitrovic, & Goller, 2016; Scott, Zhang, Le, & 
Moyle, 2017). Therefore,
certain characteristics of an individual’s eye-movements when exposed to a 
series of images provide
an indicator of the subject’s relative aesthetic evaluation of those images.

The aim of this paper then is to provide a method for evaluating the relative 
beauty of a series of
images of the coral, ﬁsh and other underwater characteristics of the GBR. The 
method was tested by
examining the relationship between eye-tracking measures and respondent beauty 
scores. Speciﬁ-
cally, sixty-six respondents were asked to rank the beauty of 21 underwater 
photographs on a 10-
point scale. The averages of these rankings were correlated with visual 
attention measures of the
same images obtained using eye-tracking methods in a laboratory setting (Scott, 
Green, & Fairley,
2016). The paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating the potential 
of using eye-tracking
technology in aesthetic research: signiﬁcant correlations between average 
perceived beauty rankings
and average eye-tracking measures were conﬁrmed.

Literature review

Aesthetic experience and beauty

The conceptualization of beauty may be grouped into objective and subjective 
approaches (Lothian,
1999). The ﬁrst considers that beauty is an objective and intrinsic 
characteristic of an object. In this
view  beauty  is  ‘an  aspect  of  the  experience  of  idealisation  in  which 
 an  object(s),  sound(s),  or
concept(s) is believed to possess qualities of formal perfection’ (Hagman, 
2002, p. 661). Interaction
with,     or  experience  of,  objects  with  this  property  leads  to  
recognition  of  their  intrinsic  beauty.
Indeed the ability to recognize beauty is an important human capacity, and the 
‘subjective experi-
ence of beauty leads to a sublime and exalted state that is unique, 
psychologically signiﬁcant and
desirable’ (Hagman,  2002,  p.  661).  The  sense  of  beauty  is  often  found 
 in  nature  and  associated
with      a feeling of wholeness, pleasure, a lessening of anxiety, awe, joy, 
excitement, relaxation and con-
tentment (Kirillova & Lehto, 2016; Lynn, Chen, Scott, & Benckendorﬀ, 2017; 
Todd, 2009).

The phrase ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder’ reﬂects an alternative 
subjective approach to the
conceptualization of beauty. This means that an object can have no objective 
property of beauty and
that  it  is  the  person’s  perception  and  interpretation  of  the  object  
that  determines  its  perceived
beauty. This subjective view considers that recognition of beauty is ‘a 
pleasure which is experienced
through  the  perception  of  an  object’  (Lothian,  1999,  p.  190).  This  
study  adopts  the  subjective
approach to beauty treating it as a human reaction that varies across diﬀerent 
viewers and cultures
(Hekkert & Leder, 2008). Such human reactions are measurable and such 
measurements can provide
an objective measure of ‘beauty’. This second approach is consistent with the 
empirical aesthetics of
Berlyne (1973) whereby neuroscientiﬁc evidence is considered to strengthen, 
complement, and con-
strain explanation of beauty at the psychological level (Cela-Conde, Agnati, 
Huston, Mora, & Nadal,
2011; Leder & Nadal, 2014). Thus, the perceived beauty of a landscape is 
derived from perceptual
responses of respondents (Kara, 2013; Karmanov, 2009).


Compared to beauty, the more general term of aesthetics deals with the 
‘experience of objects
which  provide  the  consumer  with  an  element  of  beauty’  (Charters,  
2006,  p.  239).  Therefore,
objects  which  are  perceived  as  beautiful  are  experienced  as  
pleasurable  through  an  aesthetic
process. This aesthetic experience of human beauty inﬂuences subsequent 
judgements, favouring
the beautiful. (Lindell & Lindell, 2014). Hence, objects, or images, which are 
pleasing to the eye,
are of considered of higher value in terms of their aesthetic beauty (Haas et 
al., 2015). In this way,
the concept of perceived beauty is similar to attractiveness (Lindell & 
Lindell, 2014, p. 768).

Prior research has found that aesthetic appreciation of art relies on the 
brain’s reward processes
involved in reward representation, prediction and anticipation, aﬀective 
self-monitoring, emotions,
and the generation of pleasure (Leder & Nadal, 2014). This suggests that reward 
(i.e. wanting the aes-
thetic experience) triggers aesthetic preference, judgment, and subsequently 
decision (Leder, Belke,
Oeberst,  &  Augustin,  2004;  Reimann,  Zaichkowsky,  Neuhaus,  Bender,  &  
Weber,  2010).  Cognitive
appraisal  describes  the  process  by  which  individuals  evaluate  whether  
an  encounter  with  the
environment  is  relevant  to  their  well-being  (Lazarus,  1991).  The  type  
and  intensity  of  aesthetic
response  to  an  object  depend  on  the  degree  of  expertise  of  the  
viewer.  In  a  comparison  of
experts and non-experts (measured by facial EMG and several rating scales), 
experts gave distinctively
diﬀerent evaluations, not only to the artworks but also to a control set of 
emotional images (Leder &
Nadal, 2014). This suggests that expert evaluations of scenery and images may 
vary from those of lay
people. The aesthetic evaluation processes that allow the identiﬁcation of an 
object as having the
attribute of beauty are based on sensory (usually visual) perception (Ross, 
2016). Human visual per-
ception allows attentional processes a major function in selecting relevant 
stimuli for detailed exam-
ination (Nummenmaa et al., 2006).

Tourism and beauty

Beauty is recognized as an important characteristic of tourism destinations and 
experiences (Beza,
2010; Breiby & Slåtten, 2015; Horng, Chou, Liu, & Tsai, 2013; Kirillova et al., 
2014; Kirillova & Lehto,
2016;  Knudsen,  Metro-Roland,  &  Rickly,  2015),  albeit  from  a  
traditionally  British  perspective
(Andrews, 1989). Beauty is often associated with natural scenery (Beza, 2010), 
emotional reactions
(Breiby  &  Slåtten,  2015),  and  subsequently  beneﬁts  including  
restoration  (Kaplan,  1995).  Breiby
(2014, p. 171) found that experts considered that the aesthetics of 
nature-based tourism involved
key concepts of ‘perception, structure, senses, beauty, and pleasant’. However, 
as in the literature
of  consumer  behaviour  (Patrick  &  Peracchio,  2010),  psychology  (Arnheim, 
 1966;  Leder  &  Nadal,
2014)  and  nature  research  (Carlson,  2009),  the  principal  perspective  
on  aesthetic  appreciation
found in the tourism-related literature is objective in nature, that is that 
the beauty of a scene is con-
nected to the characteristics of a destination rather than the observer’s 
evaluation (Kirillova, 2015;
Kirillova et al., 2014; Kirillova & Lehto, 2016).

Again, despite the importance of sun and sea tourism, the literature of marine 
aesthetics and coral
reefs is restricted (Cracknell, White, Pahl, & Depledge, 2017; White et al., 
2010). Pocock (2002) and
Johnston and Smith (2014) have discussed the aesthetic values of the GBR 
highlighting the signiﬁ-
cance of beauty for World Heritage listing. Other studies have looked at 
people’s preferences for,
aﬀective responses to, and the restorative potential of, diﬀerent types of 
public aquaria exhibits
(Cracknell et al., 2017). Dinsdale (2009) showed that human visual evaluations 
provided a consistent
judgment of coral reef status regardless of their previous knowledge or 
exposure to these particular
ecosystems. There is evidence that the evaluations of images of the pristine or 
damaged coral reefs
can be in terms of pleasant or ugly. Coral reef photographs are associated with 
the ‘good’ end of the
evaluation dimension (Dinsdale, 2009).

In summary, the beauty of a photo is considered here a personal judgment based 
on pleasant
emotional  reactions  to  the  photo.  The  perception  of  beauty  causes  a  
reorientation  of  attention
towards the object that is perceived as beautiful. Therefore, the study 
proposes that there will be


signiﬁcant correlations between attention to and perceived beauty/ugliness of 
images of underwater
coral reefs and scenes. The following hypotheses are to be tested:

H1: Viewers will pay more attention (measured by ﬁxation count, ﬁxation 
duration and total time visit) to beautiful
pictures than ugly pictures of natural scenes.

H2: There is a signiﬁcant relationship between eye-tracking measures (ﬁxation 
count, ﬁxation duration and total
time visit) and perceived beauty of natural scenes.

Methodology

There have been a number of methods used to study the perceived pleasantness or 
aesthetic reac-
tion to landscape scenery and underwater images. These include photograph 
viewing and rating of
pleasantness (Cracknell et al., 2017; Locher, Krupinski, Mello-Thoms, & Nodine, 
2007) evaluations of
attractiveness and emotion (White et al., 2010), and use of psychophysical 
approaches to assessment
of aesthetic quality of natural environments (Chang, Hammitt, Chen, Machnik, & 
Su, 2008). Existing
methods used to determine scenic preference often depend on rating the 
perceived beauty of an
image holistically or in terms of presence or absence of visual elements such 
as buildings or trees
(DEHP, 2017). Photo rating is a standard method with a long tradition in both 
landscape architecture
and environmental psychology and is useful when looking at components of a 
scene (Van den Berg,
Koole, & Van der Wulp, 2003).

More recently, eye-tracking techniques have been used for the assessment of 
landscape charac-
teristics (Nordh, 2012). Eye-tracking techniques can measure visual attention 
processes in terms of
the number or duration of eye-ﬁxations on images. Eye-tracking has been used to 
measure preferen-
tial attention to emotional pictures (Calvo & Lang, 2004) and videos (Teixeira, 
Wedel, & Pieters, 2012).
These studies indicate that an emotional picture, either pleasant or 
unpleasant, is more likely to be
ﬁxated than a neutral picture (Simola, Le Fevre, Torniainen, & Baccino, 2015). 
Emotional pictures
capture attention during the early stages of picture processing by our brain 
(Nummenmaa et al.,
2006).  Similar  eﬀects  have  been  observed  between  facial  attractiveness  
and  ﬁxation  duration
(Leder  et  al.,  2016).  Similarly,  EEG  studies  indicate  that  attention  
is  captured  automatically  by
emotional images (Hajcak, MacNamara, & Olvet, 2010). A recent meta-analysis 
shows an attentional
bias for positive as compared with neutral stimuli (Pool, Brosch, Delplanque, & 
Sander, 2016). Empiri-
cal research has noted diﬀerences in attention as measured by eye ﬁxations to 
pleasant and unplea-
sant scenes (Calvo & Lang, 2004). Interestingly, eye-tracking studies have 
noted that expert and lay
viewers look at diﬀerent parts of a landscape scene (Dupont, Antrop, & Van 
Eetvelde, 2015). This study
uses two methods to evaluate 21 images of underwater reef scenes; eye-tracking 
provides a measure
of attention while self-completion questions were used to rate images and 
obtain an average beauty
rating of each picture. This will allow the correlation between these two 
methods to be established.
Each of the variables to be measured is discussed below.

Image rating: There are varieties of diﬀerent measurement items used to 
evaluate the perceived

beauty of a scene or image. These include ratings of pleasantness (Locher et 
al., 2007) and beauty
(Arriaza,  Cañas-Ortega,  Cañas-Madueño,  &  Ruiz-Aviles,  2004).  For  
example,  (Beza,  2010)  used  a
bipolar rating scale, based on the semantic diﬀerential of ‘beautiful’ and 
‘ugly’. The overall ranking
of perceived beauty (rather than about aesthetic dimensions of beautiful 
scenes) is measured by
questions about attractiveness or beauty (Cracknell et al., 2017; Tan & Kuo, 
2014; Wang, Zhao, &
Liu, 2016). A 10-point scale is common  in aesthetic research (Cracknell et 
al., 2017; White et al.,
2010)  which  provides  comparable  and  transferable  data  in  comparison  
with  other  5-  or  7-point
scales  (Dawes,  2008).  Hence,  a  self-report  item  was  used  in  this  
study  evaluating  the  beauty  of
each picture (1-Not beautiful at all, 10-Very beautiful).

Attention and beauty: Eye tracking is a useful technique for objective 
measurement of attention
(Scott et al., 2017) by determining when an individual’s eye pauses to examine 
or interpret a com-
ponent of an advertisement or image (Rayner, Rotello, Stewart, Keir, & Duﬀy, 
2001). Eye-tracking


has been used to measure preference for advertising (Scott et al., 2016), and 
interest in parts of a
landscape image (De Lucio, Mohamadian, Ruiz, Banayas, & Bernaldez, 1996). The 
number of discrete
ﬁxations (in a given region over the course of scene viewing) is related to the 
rated informativeness of
the region, with regions rated more informative receiving more ﬁxations 
(Henderson & Hollingworth,
1999). In the present study, the ﬁxation count, ﬁxation duration and total time 
visit were used to
measure attention, considered here as to the degree of attraction for the 
observer (i.e. a measure
of beauty).

Procedure: The study was conducted in April and May 2017 under the ethical 
approval GU 2017/

537. Respondents provided informed consent before their participation. Tobii 
T60 Eye Tracker model
2013 equipment was used to collect eye-tracking data. Respondents sat in a 
chair in an upright pos-
ition and viewed images on a computer monitor in a quiet laboratory.  A 
convenience sampling
method was applied to facilitate data collection. Sixty-six participants were 
recruited after a cali-
bration process in order to exclude subjects with eyes problems. During the 
calibration procedure,
subjects were asked to look at speciﬁc points on the screen, also known as 
calibration dots while
their eye movements were collected and analyzed (‘Tobii Pro online guidelines,’ 
2019). Next, partici-
pants were asked to look at images of the GBR. Participants were free to look 
at each picture on the
screen as long as they want during which time their eye ﬁxations were recorded. 
The order of pictures
was randomized to avoid any possible eﬀect related to picture order. After 
viewing a picture, respon-
dents rated the picture beauty on a 10-point scale (1-Not beautiful at all, 
10-Very beautiful).

Analysis: The Tobii eye-tracker provides a record of the direction of the 
respondent’s gaze some 60
times per second and ‘maps’ this onto a location on the image being viewed. 
Subsequently, these
mapped points were analyzed to determine ﬁxation count and duration data. In 
the study, the criteria
for ﬁxation was 200 ms which is the standard in eye-tracking research (Jacob & 
Karn, 2003; Pan,
Zhang, & Smith, 2011; Wang & Sparks, 2016). Eye-tracking data including ﬁxation 
count, ﬁxation dur-
ation, and total time visit were estimated by Tobii eye-tracking software. The 
eye-tracking data and
image beauty evaluations for each photo were then exported to IBM SPSS version 
24 where t-tests
and correlation analyses were conducted. All pictures used in the eye-tracking 
experiment, their
average beauty scores and heat maps showing participants’ attention are 
provided in the appendix.

Results

Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the demographic proﬁle of the whole 
sample of respon-
dents (n = 66) (Table 1). A reasonable balance was achieved between male and 
female respondents.
Most subjects were under 35 years old (63 participants) and are students (59 
participants).

The research hypotheses were tested through several steps of data analysis. 
First, the scores for
the 21 selected pictures were grouped and their average beauty scores used to 
identify beautiful
(beauty scores ≥5) and ugly pictures (beauty scores <5). The results show that 
13 pictures were

Note: PBeauty: Picture beauty scores rated by participants (from 1 to 10 
points). PFDuration: Fixation duration in the picture (i.e. the
average length of all ﬁxations during all recordings in the whole picture). A 
longer ﬁxation means that the object is more enga-
ging in some way. PFCount: Fixation count in the picture (i.e. the average 
number of ﬁxations in the picture). PTimeVisit: Total
time visit for a picture (i.e. the average time participants spent looking at a 
picture).

rated as ugly and 8 pictures were considered as beautiful. An independent 
t-test was conducted to
determine whether there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the eye-tracking measures 
between beautiful
and ugly photos. All eye-tracking measures were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between 
two groups of pic-
tures.  Beautiful  pictures  have  higher  means  for  three  eye-tracking  
measures  including  picture
ﬁxation duration, picture ﬁxation count and picture total time visit in 
comparison with ugly pictures
(with beauty rating under 5) (Table 1). This initial result conﬁrms hypothesis 
1 that beautiful pictures
attract more attention than ugly pictures.

Next, a correlation analysis was conducted to verify whether self-report beauty 
evaluation and
eye-tracking  measures  are  correlated  (Table  2).  The  results  indicate  
that  eye-tracking  measures
(i.e.  ﬁxation  count,  ﬁxation  duration,  total  time  visit)  were  
signiﬁcantly  correlated  with  picture
beauty  rating.  Results  of  correlation  analysis  provided  a  basis  for  
the  next  step  of  testing
regression  models  to  verify  the  relationship  between  eye-tracking  
measures  and  perceived
beauty.

Three regression models were separately conducted using the three eye-tracking 
measures that
were  correlated  with  picture  beauty  (Table  4).  Because  picture  ﬁxation 
 duration,  picture  ﬁxation
count  and  picture  total  visit  time  were  also  correlated  (Table  3),  
they  were  not  included  in  the
same regression model. All three single regression models were found to predict 
picture beauty.
Of the three eye-tracking measures, picture ﬁxation count is the most reliable 
indicator of picture
beauty  explaining  45.1%  of  variations  in  picture  beauty  (Adjusted  R² = 
0.451,  p < 0.01).  Hence,
tourist attention paid to a natural picture as measured by eye-tracking device 
reﬂects their beauty
evaluation. Based on this, hypothesis 2 is conﬁrmed.

Dependent variable: picture beauty

Discussion

This research has tested an innovative eye-tracking method to measure the 
relative perceived beauty
of images taken of underwater scenes from the Great Barrier Reef. In this 
study, beautiful pictures
which are pleasant to the eyes will attract more attention than ugly pictures 
(H1 conﬁrmed). On
average,  participants  spend  about  8  seconds  viewing  a  beautiful  
picture  in  comparison  for  5.4
seconds per ugly picture. Our research outcome supports for aspects of Leder et 
al.’s (2004) ﬁve-
stage  model  of  aesthetic  appreciation  and  aesthetic  judgment.  The  ﬁrst 
 three  stages  involve
bottom-up perceptual processes to recognize and analyse pictorial features 
(i.e. perceptual analyses),
its profotypicality and familiarity (i.e. implicit memory integration) and its 
style and content (i.e. expli-
cit classiﬁcation). Normally, these automatic processing stages could occur 
rapidly and automatically
in the ﬁrst 3 seconds of looking at a picture (Locher et al., 2007). Hence, 
people are able to make a
rapid evaluation of a picture’s content and aesthetic appeal at ﬁrst glance 
(after the ﬁrst 3 seconds)
(Rasche  &  Koch,  2002).  The  fourth  and  ﬁfth  stages  of  aesthetic  
experience  involving  self-related
interpretation  and  aesthetic  appreciation  are  more  deliberate  (i.e.  
top-down)  processes.  Viewers
can decide to stop or spend more time looking at a picture depending on its 
aesthetic pleasure
(Locher et al., 2007). Our research outcome conﬁrms the importance of using 
beautiful and pleasant
images in tourism marketing to capture and retain tourist attention (Wang & 
Sparks, 2016). Because
tourists are exposed to thousands of visual stimuli per day, audience attention 
to a tourism marketing
message is a key success factor (Scott et al., 2017).

Moreover, it was found that eye-tracking measures (i.e. ﬁxation count, ﬁxation 
duration and total
time visit) can be used as reliable indicators of perceived beauty of natural 
scenes (H2 conﬁrmed).
Aesthetic value is an important criterion of natural attractions like the Great 
Barrier Reef and its
World  Heritage  listing.  To  date,  there  is  no  systematic  and  
consistent  methodology  on  how  to
assess the ‘natural beauty or aesthetic value’ (as articulated as part of 
Criterion vii in the statements
of Outstanding Universal Value) within the World Heritage Convention (Mitchell, 
Migon, Denyer, &
Leitão, 2013). This study contributes to the development of such a methodology. 
The eye-tracking
method suggests a means for objective measurement of the relative beauty of 
natural images and
potentially for monitoring the aesthetics of environments such as underwater 
coral reefs. Use of
this method may allow the tracking of beauty over time and hence contribute to 
monitoring the sus-
tainability of world heritage areas (de Fauconberg, Berthon, & Berthon, 2018). 
Based on our research
ﬁndings, eye-tracking technology could also be applied by tourism marketers in 
market research to
compare and identify the most beautiful and attractive images of a natural 
attraction for tourism pro-
motion purpose.

The results of this research provide further evidence of the usefulness of 
eye-tracking methods

speciﬁcally  and  of  cognitive  psychology  theory  and  methods  generally  
in  informing  tourism
research.  Previous  studies  primarily  applied  retrospective  self-reported  
measures  of  attention
(Dowray,  Swartz,  Braxton,  &  Viera,  2013;  Mackison,  Wrieden,  &  
Anderson,  2010;  Verbeke  &
Ward, 2006) which are likely biased operationalization of identifying true 
attention (Bialkova &
van  Trijp,  2011).  Hence,  researchers  have  recently  begun  to  apply  
eye-tracking  methods  to
study  the  actual  attention  of  tourists  paid  to  tourism  marketing  
stimuli,  for  example,  images


for hotels and airline marketing (Babakhani, Ritchie, & Dolnicar, 2017; Wang, 
Tsai, & Tang, 2018).
Eye-tracking can be beneﬁcial in investigating many further topics including 
evaluation of spon-
sorship (Breuer & Rumpf, 2012), advertising eﬀectiveness (Scott et al., 2016) 
and wayﬁnding (Xia,
Arrowsmith,  Jackson,  &  Cartwright,  2008).  Mobile  eye-tracking  technology 
 is  also  available  for
future  research  to  track  individual  eye  movements  at  real-life  tourism 
 attractions  such  as  a
national park or art exhibition.

Moreover, we highly recommend further use of other advanced research 
technologies such as
heart rate, skin conductance, EEG in advancing tourism research (Li, Scott, & 
Walters, 2015). These
technologies are nowadays available at reasonable costs and have great 
potential to reduce research
bias due to memory-based measures. Combining these research tools to examine 
the nature and
relationships  between  tourist  attention  (eye-tracking),  emotion  (heart  
rate  or  skin  conductance),
involvement and information processing (EEG) is very promising in moving the 
tourist behaviour
ﬁeld forward.

This research is an initial study only and has several limitations. First, only 
one item was used to
measure respondents self-reported beauty ranking, and it may also be useful to 
use other scales
such as visual appeal (Mathwick, Malhotra, & Rigdon, 2001). Further research is 
needed to develop
this  method  and  compare  its  results  with  the  expert-based  judgment  of 
 aesthetic  value  (Beza,
2010; Schirpke, Timmermann, Tappeiner, & Tasser, 2016) especially of coral 
reefs (Goldman, 1990;
Johnston & Smith, 2014). Second, this study is limited in terms of the number 
of images used (21
photos).  The  method  needs  retesting  using  larger  numbers  of  photos  – 
perhaps  60  pictures  or
more.  Third,  picture  elements  were  not  investigated  in  this  study.  
However,  it  was  found  that
photos with brightly coloured coral, multiple ﬁsh species, clear water and 
iconic species such as
turtles  were  found  more  attractive.  Photos  rated  as  less  attractive  
typically  showed  man-made
objects such as discarded cans or bottles or expanses of white coral, less 
clear water and less ﬁsh.
Therefore, beauty factors such as the quality of images, including factors such 
as colour composition,
saturation and brightness (Seresinhe, Preis, & Moat, 2017) and special research 
methods such as con-
joint  analysis  may  be  useful  to  determine  the  contribution  of  image  
elements  to  aesthetic
assessment.

Forth, only basic eye-tracking measures were employed in this study, but a 
variety of other eye-

tracking metrics and techniques are available to measure attention such as 
gaze-entropy (Raptis et al.,
2017) and scan-path length (Katsini et al., 2018). Hence, more sophisticated 
eye-tracking experiments
should be set up in future studies. Fifth, only Australian participants were 
employed for this study. It
would be useful to examine respondents from diﬀerent cultural backgrounds (Asia 
vs Western) to
determine if there are diﬀerences in their aesthetic perception. There is some 
evidence to suggest
that there are diﬀerences in ﬁxations on areas of interest in an image (Wang & 
Sparks, 2016) and vari-
ations in eye-movements during scene perception related to the culture of the 
subject (Chua, Boland,
& Nisbett, 2005).
