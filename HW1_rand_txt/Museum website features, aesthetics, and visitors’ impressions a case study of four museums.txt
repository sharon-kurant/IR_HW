In an effort to extend previous work on developing general recommendations for
design of art museum websites, we evaluated four museum websites (the Tate, the
Dallas Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and the Rijksmuseum)
and examined the relationships between website features, virtual visitors’ impressions
and estimates of repeat visits to the site. The study produced a comparative evaluation
of the four museum websites and identified strengths and weaknesses in the sites’
navigation, design, and content features. The study found that website aesthetics was
the strongest predictor of the visitor’s overall impressions. Ability to manipulate
content (e.g., download, print, and zoom in and out) was also linked to the visitor’s
inclination to make repeat visits to the site. This paper describes the methods and
results of the study and proposes a set of recommendations for the development and
evaluation of art museum websites.

Introduction
Much has been written about the importance of an online presence to further the mission
of art museums (Honeysett 2007; Jones 2008) yet there are few clear guidelines to aid
museums and similar institutions in developing engaging and informative websites. In an
effort to further the understanding of visitors’ perceptions of museum websites and to
develop design recommendations, this paper (1) reviews several relevant studies aimed to
develop a framework for museum website design and evaluation and (2) describes a twophase study that examined user perspectives of desirable museum website features.

Relevant literature
In recent years, museums have actively begun to develop their online presence in order to
increase and improve visitor interaction with their virtual and physical collections (Barry
2006; Ciolfi, Bannon, and Fernström 2008; Bartindale et al. 2011; Ciolfi and McLoughlin
2012). Virtual visitors expect museum websites to enable and promote learning, to be
functional, easily navigable, visually pleasing and enjoyable (Tractinsky, Katz, and Ikar
2000; Zhang and Li 2005; Lin, Fernandez, and Gregor 2012; Van Dijk, Lingnau, and
Kockelkorn 2012). While museums develop and utilize their online presence in different

ways, museums generally aim to encourage user interaction and engagement with their
collections (De Angeli, Sutcliffe, and Hartmann 2006; Marty 2007; Stewart and
Marcketti 2012).
Our review of the literature on the design of museum website interfaces identified two
clusters of studies: a larger cluster that reports findings concerning the usability of
specific museum websites and a smaller cluster that aims to develop more general
frameworks for evaluation and design of museum websites.
A heightened interest in the usability of museum websites is not surprising, since in
the past decade, a significant number of publications focused on the importance of
usability in virtual visitors’ interactions with museum websites. For example, within the
context of image collections, Walz and Brenny (2005) conducted a heuristic selfinspection evaluation of the University of Minnesota Architecture and Landscape visual
resources collection. By observing participants’ interactions and collecting participants’
assessments of the site, the authors identified specific design weaknesses such as
navigation and labeling conventions, and proposed a baseline evaluation method for the
website. In an effort to determine the effects of navigation designs on usability, De
Angeli, Sutcliffe, and Hartmann (2006) compared two websites with the same content but
different, interactive, menu-based, navigation designs. The study showed that perception
of information quality was affected by the design style. Based on their findings, the
authors outlined specific recommendations for the design of museum website navigation.
Cunliffe, Kritou, and Tudhope (2001) tested and critiqued several methods for evaluating
small museum websites, including log analysis, direct observation and online questionnaires, and reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of each method. Haynes and
Zambonini (2007) tested several usability tools, including Google Analytics, to examine
virtual visitors’ behavior on five museum websites. The data enabled the authors to
construct user profiles of the museum’s virtual visitors for the use in the museum website
usability studies. In a study of the Indianapolis Museum of Art’s website, Fantoni, Stein,
and Bowman (2012) examined how a visitor’s intent to use a website affected the ways
users interacted with the site. The authors concluded that users’ reasons for visiting a
website affected the time they spent on the website as well as the number of artworks
searched and downloaded. Using the Quai Branly museum’s and the Atlanta History
Center’s websites, Pallud and Straub (2014) examined variables that influence users’
online behavior on museum websites. The authors concluded that website aesthetics was
the most influential factor in motivating users either to return to the websites or to visit
the physical museums.
A number of publications go further than the usability assessment of specific museum
websites or their features and aim to develop more general evaluation and design
frameworks. In one such study, Pallas and Economides (2008) developed a Museum’s
Sites Evaluative Framework (MUSEF) and tested it on 210 museum websites. The
proposed MUSEF included six areas that museum websites are evaluated according to:
content, presentation, usability, interactivity and feedback, e-services, and technical. In
turn, each area included evaluation rubrics for specific website features. For example, the
usability area included user interface, site structure and organization, navigation,
orientation, and search-related features. A similar framework was proposed by Paolini
et al. (2002). The authors developed the Milano – Lugano Evaluation Method (MiLE)
framework for evaluating cultural heritage websites and explored the ‘universe of
possible functions that a museum website should support.’ MiLE emphasized the
inspection method of testing, using various facets of abstract and concrete tasks for

Museum Management and Curatorship

193

museum websites such as technology, navigation, content, illocutionary force, graphic
and other evaluative areas similar to MUSEF’s. The authors tested the method on various
websites, including the Louvre and the Royal Ontario Museum websites, and proposed a
model for evaluating information currency, information richness, quality of information
organization, and multilinguisticity of museum websites. In an effort to develop a general
website evaluation framework, Chiou, Lin, and Perng (2010) analyzed the trends in 83
website evaluation articles published between 1995 and 2006. The authors found that in
the wake of usability testing, museums often overlooked web strategy as the means of
conveying museums’ missions and objectives through their web presence. To ensure
consistency between web strategy and website presence, the authors proposed a five-stage
process to support internal evaluation of websites, including identifying the website
strategy, developing an evaluation scheme, running the evaluation, computing scores, and
analyzing the data.
While evaluation frameworks like MUSEF and MiLE offer the means to test the
quality of existing sites, few studies take a step further and offer specific recommendations for design of museum websites. One early example of such a study is the work of
Dyson and Moran (2000) who analyzed seven websites with the aim of generating
recommendations for the design of the Rural History Centre website at the University of
Reading as well as developing a general framework for evaluating digital visual
collections. The study developed a set of recommendations for design of museum
websites, including the importance of guided browsing and clear and consistent website
architecture. While the MiLE framework developed by the Bologna Group (Paolini et al.
2002) did not include design recommendations, the authors hoped the framework could
be used to prescribe functions for museum websites. More recently, Lin, Gregor, and
Ewing (2009) and Lin, Fernandez, and Gregor (2012) proposed a website evaluation
framework that focused on assessing user enjoyment associated with the use of virtual
museum collections. The authors attempted to evaluate enjoyment associated with
multimedia content, interactive features (e.g., games), and proposed incorporating the
principles of ‘stickiness,’ storyline, mood building, fun and social interactions in museum
website designs.
In an effort to extend previous work on developing general recommendations for the
design of art museum websites, we developed a study to evaluate several museum
website design features, examine the relationships between these features, and describe
virtual visitors’ initial and overall impressions and their estimated repeat visits to the site.
This paper describes the methods and results of the study and provides recommendations
for the development and evaluation of art museum websites.
Methods
This study is part of a multiphase project that aims to develop design recommendations
for art museum websites.
During the initial phase, we explored and evaluated the functionality of six digital art
collections of various sizes and institutional affiliations using Nielsen’s (1993) evaluation
framework criteria:
.

Learnability: degree of difficulty in accomplishing basic tasks (e.g., search,
browse, review and manipulation of results, etc.) during the first encounter with
the interface.

194

.

Efficiency: after gaining familiarity with a system, speed with which basic tasks
can be performed.
Aesthetics: perceived attractiveness of the interface.
Errors: number and severity of errors encountered while using the system, and
ease of recovery from the errors.
Memorability: after a period of nonuse, the degree of difficulty in re-establishing
proficiency.
Reflection: quality and polarity of memories associated with the use of the interface.
Satisfaction: degree of satisfaction with the interface design based on the overall
evaluation of task-specific, aesthetic and other features.

The seven collections that comprised the initial study sample included: (1) Google Art
Project, (2) Artsy, (3) Brooklyn Museum, (4) Los Angeles County Museum of Art, (5)
Museum of Fine Arts Boston, and (6) the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.
The initial study (Lopatovska et al. 2013) established five categories of design
features that users found valuable in their interactions with online collections, including:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)

search/browse features,
image manipulation features,
interactive features,
website aesthetics, and
usability.

This paper reports on the second phase of the study, which examined relationships
between website features within the five outlined above categories (search, image
manipulation, interactivity, aesthetics, and usability), initial and overall impressions of the
website, and likelihood of return visits to the website. We were particularly interested
in determining which categories of website features or visitors’ initial impressions
affected virtual visitors’ overall impressions and their estimated likelihood of repeat
visits. Figure 1 represents the main study constructs and the relationships investigated.

The study was conducted with a group of 10 participants: 4 males and 6 females, ages
24–53. Since the study was designed as a usability test, a small sample size of
participants was considered acceptable (Nielsen 2000). The study was designed as a
course exercise for Information Science students enrolled in a master-level course at Pratt
Institute. All participants had high information literacy skills. Most of the participants
were art novices with only two students having formal education in art and/or design and
architecture.
After piloting the method on several museum websites in 2013 and in early 2014,
four websites representing a balance between traditional and innovative website features
were selected for the study (i.e., the Tate, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, and the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). The spring 2014 versions of
the four museum websites were analyzed in the study (Appendix 2).
For each of the websites, participants were asked to indicate the types of features
offered and rate their experiences using a 5-point semantic Likert scale where 1
corresponded to ‘extremely negative’ and 5 corresponded to an ‘extremely positive’
experience. The questionnaire was designed to collect data about the five categories of
online features identified during the first study phase, including: (1) search/browse
features, (2) image manipulation features, (3) interactive features, (4) aesthetics, and (5)
usability (the list of specific features within the five broad categories can be found in
Table 1). Since we were interested in examining how these features affect the overall
impression of a website and a visitor’s estimate of his or her repeat visits, we added these
questions to the study instrument. In addition to identifying the presence and rating of a
certain feature, participants were also encouraged to provide comments explaining their
scores. (Table 1 illustrates the types and summary of data collected by the online
questionnaire.)
All evaluations were completed in a lab during approximately one hour.
The online questionnaire collected two types of data: numeric ratings of various
website features and text of participants’ comments explaining their ratings. The data
were analyzed by applying appropriate statistical and content analysis techniques
discussed in the next section.
Results
For the purpose of analysis, participants’ numeric responses were grouped into eight
broader variables representing the following website characteristics: visitors’ initial
impression, overall/final impression, likelihood of a repeat visit, aesthetics, search/browse
features, usability, image manipulation and interactive features. The composite scores were
created for each of the variables by summing up the answers to individual questionnaire
items. For example, if a participant rated a particular museum website’s Social Media
feature as ‘2,’ Comment support as ‘3,’ Tagging as ‘3’ and Gaming elements as ‘5,’ the
total Interactive Features score for the website was calculated to be ‘13.’
Based on participant ratings of museum features, the Rijksmuseum website received
the highest average scores on initial and overall impressions, aesthetics, search/browse,
and selected usability features. The Tate received high scores on selected interactive
features and, despite lack of certain features, the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) received
the highest average score on the likelihood of a repeat visit.
Stepwise, or statistical, regression analysis was used to test whether overall
impression and likelihood of a repeat site visit scores were predicted by initial

impressions, site’s aesthetics, usability, search/browse, image manipulation, and interactive feature scores.
The results of the stepwise regression1 suggest that aesthetics scores were good
predictors of overall impression scores: the higher participants rated the aesthetic
properties of the website, the better overall impressions they had of the website.

Museum Management and Curatorship

The regression test that aimed to explain the variance of the estimated repeat visits
scores resulted in a weak statistically significant model that explained 27% of the repeat
visits scores: R2 = .27, F(1, 32) = 11.307, p < 0.01. Scores on image manipulation
features explained the biggest proportion of variance in the repeat visits scores: β[beta] =
.52, t(3.363) = 3.36, p < 0.01. Analysis suggested that the image manipulation scores
were the strongest predictors of estimated repeat visit to the website.
The online questionnaire used to collect participant ratings of various website features
also collected comments on specific factors contributing to their ratings. The text of
participants’ comments was coded using a content analysis technique. The three major
themes that emerged were related to the sites’ navigation (N = 217), design (N = 99) and
content (N = 40). The website associated with the highest number of participants’
comments was that of the Rijksmuseum (N = 107), followed by the Guggenheim
(N = 89), the Tate (N = 82), and DMA (N = 78) (Table 2).
Polarity of participants’ comments was also analyzed by coding text of participants’
responses into positive, negative and neutral categories. Appendix 1 illustrates the
distribution and types of participant comments that were mentioned in more than 5% of
participants’ responses. In evaluating the Rijksmuseum website, the largest number of
comments focused on the site’s navigation. More specifically, participants were largely
positive about the site’s browsing and filtered search features, while a regular search
received negative comments. Participants’ comments also provided positive feedback on
the Rijksmuseum’s aesthetics (8 positive comments out of the total 10). In evaluating the
Guggenheim Museum website, participants were critical of some of the navigation
features, including advanced search, refined results and filtered search features. Judging
from participants’ comments, participants expressed positive or neutral sentiments about
the site’s aesthetics (clean, ‘low-risk’ design) and mixed feelings about the site’s content
organization and presentation. In participant comments for the Tate, refined search
features received both positive and negative comments from participants, while search
result filters received mostly positive feedback. In evaluating the Tate website,
participants provided positive feedback on the site’s aesthetics and noted a good balance
between traditional catalog features and modern stylistics. The DMA website received the
lowest number of participants’ comments, with participants giving mixed feedback on the
site’s aesthetics, advanced search features, content organization, and negative feedback on
filtered search features, specifically pointing to the insufficient number of filtering
options.

Limitations
The study had a number of limitations. The study was conducted with 10 participants
whose information literacy skills and knowledge of art history did not significantly vary.
While small sample sizes are acceptable on multiphase usability projects (Petrie and
Nigel 2009), a higher number of participants with diverse characteristics would have
strengthened the statistical model and improved the generalizability of findings. Future
studies should aim at recruiting a more diverse pool of participants representing various
demographic characteristics, information literacy skills, and knowledge and interest in art.
Future research should also consider diversifying a sample of museum websites and
including museums of different sizes and types of collections. The study was conducted
under controlled conditions that could have influenced participants’ interactions with
museum websites and evaluations. Future research should expand to naturalistic settings
and investigate behavior of museum visitors who have personal interests in the outcomes
of their websites’ interactions.

Discussion and conclusion
We conducted a study to examine the relationships between the five groups of website
features (search, image manipulation, interactivity, aesthetics, and usability), visitors’
initial impression of the website, visitors’ overall impressions and likelihood of return
visits to the website. Since we did not identify considerable support for the importance of
specific website features in visitors’ impression formation in the prior literature, we
initially hypothesized that any of the listed above features and/or initial impressions might
influence the visitors’ overall impressions and their estimated likelihood of repeat visits
(Figure 1). Through the analysis of visitors’ feedback on various website features, we
were able to determine that website aesthetics had the strongest effect on the overall
impression, and image manipulation features were the strongest determinants of the
estimated likelihood of repeat visits for the site. (Figure 2 helps illustrate the model of

Figure 2.

Museum Management and Curatorship

relationships between the website features, visitors’ initial and overall impressions, and
estimated likelihood of repeat visits.)
Our finding about the importance of website aesthetics in visitors’ formation of
overall impressions is consistent with previous studies that showed a strong correlation
between website design aesthetics and a visitor’s motivation to either return to a museum
website or visit the physical museum (Pallud and Straub 2014). This finding is also
supported by studies that suggest users make impressions within the initial seconds of
website use, before the user has a chance to explore navigation and content features
(Lindgaard et al. 2006; Tuch et al. 2012), and studies linking aesthetics to the user’s
perceptions of the website usability (Tractinsky, Katz, and Ikar 2000). In commenting on
the websites’ aesthetics, participants mentioned website design colors, navigation and
content presentation, and the overall site’s ‘beauty’ and pleasantness as factors attributing
to their positive or negative judgments. While our findings illustrate the importance of
creating aesthetically pleasing websites that can lead to repeat virtual visits or visits to
physical collections, more research must be conducted in order to identify specific
website features that generate positive aesthetics for target user groups.
We did not find support in the prior literature for relationships between image
manipulation features (e.g., ability to save and re-size images) and visitors’ estimated
likelihood of repeat visits, suggesting that more research into these relationships is
needed. It is worth noting that despite the high ratings of the Rijksmuseum website on the
quality of its features and aesthetics, the highest estimates for repeat visits were associated
with the DMA website. This finding suggests that while participants can be impressed by
a website’s aesthetics, additional factors, such as rich collection offerings and professional
and leisure needs, might contribute to their decision to return to the site.
The site that received the highest scores on most of the participants’ evaluations of
web features, the Rijksmuseum, also received the highest number of participants’
comments on design and usability. The high number of comments related to website
design features can also be attributed to the characteristics of the study participants, who
were Information Science students. It is possible that a study conducted with a different
pool of participants would have produced different findings and would have generated
more comments about website content than design. The analysis of the museum-specific
comments yielded common patterns in user preferences across the four websites. For
example, for all the analyzed websites, participants expressed preferences for simple,
clean, and well-balanced sites, and emphasized the importance of advanced and filtered
search features.
In the process of determining the relationships between user assessments of various
website features, visitors’ overall impressions and willingness to return to the site, the
study evaluated four museum websites at a specific point in time. Considering that some
of the institutions evaluated are in the process re-designing their websites, the study offers
a valuable insight into possible improvements and creates a baseline for comparing the
current websites designs to the future versions.
Based on the study findings, we offer the following recommendations to museum
website developers:
.

Aesthetics: focus on website aesthetics as an important determinant of the user’s
overall impression. In our study, aesthetics was defined as the perceived
attractiveness of the interface (Nielsen 2000), a concept that is hard to measure
and design for. Based on the ‘subjective’ nature of aesthetic judgments, it would

200

.

be difficult to recommend specific design features (e.g., colors and navigation)
that should be incorporated into all museum website designs. We think a more
productive approach would be to develop prototype interfaces and evaluate
aesthetic responses to these interfaces by various user groups (e.g., novices/
experts, younger/older visitors, etc). In our study, participants were asked to
identify website features that contributed to their aesthetic judgments. Another
way to measure aesthetics is to ask participants to rate the aesthetic dimensions of
a website’s design, including its perceived clarity, creativeness, sophistication,
‘joyfulness’, and other aspects (Lavie and Tractinsky 2004). Regardless of the
method chosen, designers should consider measuring aesthetics of specific
interface designs to identify features and properties that positively or negatively
affect the site’s aesthetic appeal.
Search: provide search, advanced search, and results filtering features. While the
preferred availability of advanced search and sophisticated filtering by our
participants might not indicate that all website visitors have similar preferences,
we may assume that if other information retrieval systems (e.g., ArtStor, Artsy,
and Google Art Project) provide these features, users will expect to find them on
museum websites as well.
Content manipulation: enable image saving, printing, re-sizing, and other image
manipulation features. Our participants expressed a preference for being able to
manipulate website content and disappointment when content manipulation was
limited. Previous research indicates that providing access to digital content is one
of the main functions of museum websites (Paolini et al. 2002). Access to content
is also one of the main reasons users visit museum websites (Marty 2007). In light
of our findings it may also be important to enable user control of online content
(copyright, technical, and other constraints permitting).
Website improvements and evaluations: continuously improve website design and
conduct systematic evaluations to ensure that it meets ever changing user needs
and preferences (Mayhew 1999). For example, our study did not find compelling
evidence for the importance of museum sites’ interactive features, such as social
media sharing and tagging options. This finding might be related to a low
availability of these features on the websites analyzed or the profile of the study’s
participants. Web 2.0 features are gaining popularity and are increasingly being
found on museum websites. These features create both new advantages and
disadvantages (Nielsen 2007), so the features best suited to the aims of a
particular website (e.g., promotion, crowdsourcing, and user engagement), still
need to be tested.

While additional work is needed to develop a more detailed set of museum website
design recommendations, our study strengthened previous claims for the importance of
aesthetics to museum websites and suggested the importance of content manipulation
features to visitors’ estimates of repeat visits. Future studies will continue to explore the
importance of interactive Web 2.0 features to visitor interaction and their evaluation of
museum websites and will expand research into factors contributing to the return visits to
museum websites and decisions to visit physical collections.

Note
1. Regression analysis is a statistical test used to examine relationships between two or more
variables and estimate specific changes to the value of the dependent variable (or ‘criterion
variable’) when one or more of the independent variables is changed (Freedman 2009). The
stepwise regression analysis was chosen to identify independent variables that had the strongest
effect on a dependent variable (i.e., overall impression). The regression test that aimed to explain
the variance of the overall impression scores resulted in two statistically significant models. The
first one explained 52% of the overall impression scores: R2 = .52, F(1, 32) = 32.861, p < 0.01.
In this first model, aesthetics scores explained the largest proportion of variance in the overall
impression scores: β[beta] = .72, t(5.732) = 5.73, p < 0.01. In this first model, aesthetics scores
explained the biggest proportion of variance in the overall impression scores: β[beta] = .38,
t(2.625) = 2.625, p < 0.01. The second model explained the 61% of the overall impression
scores: R2 = .61, F(2, 32) = 22.998, p < 0.01. In the second model, the biggest proportion of
variance in the overall impression scores was explained by the aesthetics scores (β[beta] = .50, t
(3.454) = 3.46, p < 0.02) and scores on the image manipulation features.

Example text
‘the search page is
nothing special; in
fact, the default
endless scroll with
pretty large thumb
nails is a bit
overwhelming.’
‘the explore pages are
nice, i like the colored
labels. also, the subject
pages for each subject,
material, or art style
are a nice
introduction.’
‘Browsing the
collection was simple
because it uses terms
that I would use in my
daily speech.’
‘aesthetically it doesn’t
seem to work for me,
the images are decent
but hard to find.’

Example text
‘There is no advanced
search available.’
‘It seems as if you
can’t use multiple
filters, which isn’t that
great.’
‘I didn’t have an
option to do this.’
‘They have a clean
website it just does not
stand out. To gain an
advantage in web
traffic they need
changes, to make risks
to stand out.’
‘Organization/
presentation of
information seem to
come across very
clear.’
‘there doesn’t seem to
be a separate advanced
search page’
‘I found this feature
easy to use and very
helpful in sorting and
narrowing results.’
‘the granularity of
topics is fantastic. i
like that i can search
for all the art that
features raised hands,
or featuring certain
flowers or themes’
‘i can save the search
and then search within
the search, which is
good. don’t see color
filters though’
‘this is a nice balance
of modern tech styling
and traditional catalog
conventions’
