Abstract.  Based  on  a  large  number  of  different  cognitive  theories  on
information  processing  procedure,  suggesting  that  individuals  have  dif-
ferent  approaches  in  the  way  they  forage,  retrieve,  process,  store  and
recall information, this paper investigates the effect of field dependence/
independence with regards to visual attention of gamers in the context
of a cultural heritage game. Gaze data were collected and analysed from
fourteen participants, who were classified as field dependent or indepen-
dent  according  to  Group  Embedded  Figures  Test  (GEFT),  a  cognitive
style elicitation instrument. The collected data were analysed quantita-
tively to examine visual attention in terms of fixation count and fixation
impact.  The  results  revealed  statistically  significant  differences  in  
both
fixation  count  and  fixation  impact  towards  interactive  game  elements.
Statistically significant differences were also measured for specific types
of game elements. Findings are expected to provide insights for design-
ers and researchers aiming to design more user–centric cultural heritage
games.

1    Introduction

In the past few years a lot of research on video games in the cultural heritage
context has been conducted [2][7][10][17], since they can enrich visitors’ 
experi-
ence and contribute towards a much desired learning outcome. To achieve this,
game designers aim to include information processing tasks through game mech-
anisms that guide users to seek and comprehend information and to acquire and
recall knowledge. Information processing is closely related to cognitive 
character-
istics, therefore it seems worth investigating the impact of cognitive 
differences
on  game  playing  in  cultural  heritage  contexts.  The  theoretical  
background  of
this work is based on cognitive theories [15][26], suggesting that individuals 
have
different  habitual  approaches  in  information  seeking,  processing  and  
retrieval,


which are related to their individual cognitive characteristics such as skills 
and
abilities, e.g. visual attention. High–level cognitive processes, such as 
cognitive
styles, have been the focus of many research endeavours explaining empirically
the observed differences in information processing tasks [1][15][23][26]. One 
of the
most  well  established,  credible  and  validated  [3][5]  cognitive  style  
is  the  Field
Dependence/Independence style [26]. It is a single dimension model having the
field dependence on the one side and the field independence on the other. Ac-
cording to this model, the individuals are classified as field dependent (FD) or
field independent (FI). FD individuals tend to prefer a more holistic way when
processing information, have difficulties in identifying details from 
information
in  complex  schemes  and  perform  better  on  inductive  tasks  [26].  On  
the  other
hand,  FI  individuals  tend  to  prefer  impersonal  orientation,  prefer  a  
more  an-
alytical  way  when  processing  information,  pay  attention  to  details  and 
 easily
separate simple elements and structures from the surrounding context [26].

2    Related Work

Several  studies  [4][18][19][24]  have  investigated  the  effect  of  
cognitive  styles  in
various application domains, such as e-learning, industrial engineering and mar-
keting,  using  eye–tracking  tools.  Focusing  on  FD/FI  cognitive  style,  
research
revealed  a  correction  between  the  FD/FI  style  and  eye  movement  and  
atten-
tion patterns, with FD users exemplifying a more disoriented and disorganised
eye motion activity and generating a greater number of fixations and FI users
following a more oriented and organised scan strategy when performing visual
exploration and web search tasks [18][19]. Shinar et al. [24] examined the rela-
tionship between field dependence and on–the–road visual search behaviour and
revealed that FD individuals require more time to process the available visual
information  and  are  less  effective  in  their  visual  search  pattern.  
Despite  that
a  number  of  application  domains  has  been  researched,  to  the  best  of  
the  au-
thors’ knowledge no other eye–tracking study has been reported on the gamers’
cognitive differences on cultural heritage game playing.

3    Eye–tracking Study

3.1     Methodology

Experimental  Design  and  Procedure  We designed an eye–tracking exper-
iment  to  investigate  the  effect  of  cognitive  styles  on  visual  
attention  during  a
cultural heritage game. To increase the validity of our study we recruited 
partic-
ipants who were a) engaged with online gaming activities more than twelve hours
per week; b) had no previous experience in playing Time Explorer; and c) had
never taken the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) before. During the study
session the players were firstly asked to complete a short demographic question-
naire; then they undertook the GEFT test; and finally they played the game. To
test the study environment and instruments and make any adjustments, a pilot
study was carried out prior to the main study.


Apparatus   The  eye  tracking  experiment  was  performed  on  Tobii  T60  Eye
Tracker,  integrated  into  a  17”  TFT  monitor  (96  dpi)  at  a  screen  
resolution  of
1280x1024 pixels. We used the browser Google Chrome v.51 with a window size
of 1040x996 pixels. Tobii T60 Eye Tracker has a tracking frequency of 60 Hz and
an accuracy of 0.5ᵒ of visual angle. The analysis of the collected gaze data was
performed using the software Tobii Pro Studio.

Participants  Twenty one undergraduate students were recruited to take part
in the eye–tracking study during the spring semester of 2016. However, only 
four-
teen of them produced valid eye–tracking data, two females (14.3%) and twelve
males (85.7%). They ranged in age between 18 and 23 years (M = 20.500, SD

= 1.852). All the participants met the requirements discussed in Experimental
Design and Procedure section.

Group  Embedded  Figures  Test   To  determine  the  participants’  cognitive
styles, the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) [20] was used. The test con-
sisted of three sections, and during each of them, the participants had to 
identify
simple forms within complex patterns in a given time. The first section was in-
troductory.  The  next  two  sections  were  the  main  ones  and  they  
consisted  of
nine   items each; five minutes were allocated to each. The score is calculated 
by
adding the number of simple forms identified correctly in the second and third
section,  thus  the  score  range  is  between  0  and  18.  During  the  
administration
and  scoring  of  the  GEFT,  the  directions  about  the  materials,  the  
test  proce-
dure, scoring and time limits described in the scoring template [27] were firmly
followed. Participants’ average score on GEFT was 11.714 (median = 12, SD =
2.894), distributed normally according to Shapiro–Wilk test (p = 0.471 > 0.05).
The classification of participants into field dependent (FD) or field 
independent
(FI) is based on a cut–off score, which however is not identified in the 
original
work [20]. However, a number of classification procedures have been developed
[8][16] and for the scope of this study the median score was adopted as the cut–
off score, i.e. 12. The participants who scored 12 or lower were classified as 
FD,
and those who scored 13 or higher as FI. Eight participants were classified as 
FD
and six as FI. The users’ scores on the GEFT test in our sample is comparably
similar  to  general  public  GEFT  test  scores  as  shown  in  several  
studies  which
embraced individuals with different demographics [3][14].

Game  The game we selected for this study was Time Explorer; a well-known
and  multiple  award  winning  game  of  British  Museum,  which  requires  
players
to perform several information processing tasks through game–play in order to
complete their objectives. Time Explorer has four different levels, each related
to            an  ancient  civilisation.  For  the  scope  of  this  study,  we 
 used  Aztec  Mexico
level.  In  order  to  complete  the  game  successfully,  the  players  had  
to  rescue  a
mystical mosaic mask and deliver it to the tribe priest. To redeem the mask, the
players needed to overcome challenges; solve problems; find and decode hidden


messages. Hidden items and knowledge artefacts, e.g. bonus facts and objects,
were scattered throughout the game, which would not only provide information
about each civilization to the players, enhancing their knowledge, but they 
could
also increase their score. In particular, the formula that calculates the final 
game
score is formed by three main parameters: the total level completion time, the
total in–game puzzle solution time and the number of hidden facts and objects
collected.  The  hidden  elements  of  the  game  are  divided  into  two  
major  types:
helpful  objects  and  bonus  items  (objects  and  facts).  The  collection  
of  helpful
objects is mandatory in order for the player to proceed in the game or complete
it,  while  the  collection  of  bonus  items  is  optional,  since  they  do  
not  provide
information crucial to game progress, but they provide general information about
the    Aztec civilisation.

Measures  For our analysis we wanted to know how visual attention on interac-
tive game elements is distributed among players with different cognitive styles.
Therefore, we assigned gaze data to areas of interest (AOIs) on the interactive
game elements. Twelve AOIs were identified for the Aztec level, representing all
the interactive game elements. The collected gaze data are based on fixations,
which  were  detected  using  the  built–in  algorithms  of  Tobii  Studio.  
The  algo-
rithms generate a fixation if recorded gaze locations of at least 100ms are 
close
to each other (radius 35 pixels). Fixations assign the entire count or duration 
to
the AOIs that contain the centre point of the fixation, and fixations projected 
on
the foveal area of the eyes may be lost. Hence, we used a technique introduced
by Buscher et al. [4], which takes into consideration fixations that are close 
to
the fixation centre using a Gaussian distribution. We used two metrics:

–  Fixation  count: the number of fixations a participant has within an AOI,
taking into consideration visits and re–visits to the AOI.

–  Fixation  impact:  a  modified  version  of  fixation  duration,  introduced 
 by
Buscher et al. [4].

3.2     Results

Fixation Count  An independent–samples t–test was run to determine if there
were differences in fixation count to any interactive object between FD and FI
players. Fixation count for each group was normally distributed, as assessed by
Shapiro–Wilk’s test (FD: 0.227 > 0.05 and FI: 0.590 > 0.05), and there was ho-
mogeneity      of variances, as assessed by Levene’s test for equality of 
variances (p =

0.169 > 0.05). The FI players had a total greater fixation count (M = 47.167, 
SD

= 17.291) than FD players (M = 24.625, SD = 9.303), a statistically significant
difference, M = 22.542, 95% CI [6.973, 38.110], t(12) = 3.155, p = 0.003 < 
0.05.

Nonetheless, not all the interactive objects of the game were mandatory for the
players in order to proceed in the game, as we discussed previously. Therefore, 
we
investigate whether there are differences in fixation count regarding each type 
of
interactive  game  elements.  An  additional  independent–samples  t–test  was  
run


for  each  element  type  to  determine  if  there  were  differences  in  
fixation  count
between  FD  and  FI  players.  Regarding  the  helpful  objects,  fixation  
count  for
each  group  was  normally  distributed,  as  assessed  by  Shapiro–Wilk’s  
test  (FD:

0.184 > 0.05 and FI: 0.819 > 0.05), and there was homogeneity of variances, as
assessed by Levene’s test for equality of variances (p = 0.513  > 0.05). The FI
players had greater fixation count to helpful objects (M = 5.167, SD = 3.656)
than FD players (M = 2.875, SD = 2.997), but there is no statistically 
significant
difference, M = 2.292, 95% CI [-1.577, 6.160], t(12) = 1.291, p = 0.221 > 0.05.
However,  there  is  a  statistically  significant  difference  for  both  
bonus  items  ac-
cording to independent–samples t–test. In particular, the FI players had greater
fixation count to bonus items (M = 42.500, SD = 13.172) than FD players (M

= 20.500, SD = 7.910) a statistically significant difference, M = 22.000, 95% CI
[9.727, 34.273], t(12) = 3.906, p = 0.002 < 0.05. Fixation count for each group
and each game element type were normally distributed, as assessed by Shapiro–
Wilk’s test, and there was homogeneity of variances, as assessed by Levene’s 
test
for equality of variances.

Fixation Impact  An independent–samples t–test was run to determine if there
were differences in fixation impact to any interactive game element between FD
and  FI  players.  Fixation  impact  for  each  group  was  normally  
distributed,  as
assessed by Shapiro–Wilk’s test (FD: 0.651 > 0.05 and FI: 0.145 > 0.05), and
there  was  homogeneity  of  variances,  as  assessed  by  Levene’s  test  for  
equality
of  variances  (p  =  0.488  > 0.05).  The  FI  players  had  a  total  greater 
 fixation
impact (M = 25.422, SD = 8.484) than FD players (M = 16.708, SD = 5.909),

a  statistically  significant  difference,  M  =  8.714,  95%  CI  [0.364,  
17.065],  t(12)

=  2.274,  p  =  0.042  < 0.05.  Likewise  fixation  count,  we  investigate  
the  effect
of cognitive style in the fixation impact of each game element type. Hence, an
additional  independent–samples  t–test  was  run  for  each  type  to  
determine  if
there  were differences in fixation impact between FD and FI players. Fixation
impact for each group was normally distributed, as assessed by Shapiro–Wilk’s
test  (FD:  0.057  > 0.05  and  FI:  0.149  > 0.05),  and  there  was  
homogeneity  of
variances,  as  assessed  by  Levene’s  test  for  equality  of  variances  (p  
=  0.882  >
0.05). The FI players had greater fixation impact towards helpful objects (M =
3.283, SD = 2.462) than FD players (M = 2.428, SD = 2.845), but there is no
statistically  significant  difference,  M  =  0.855,  95%  CI  [-2.313,  
4.022],  t(12)  =
0.588,              p  =  0.568  > 0.05.  Regarding  the  bonus  items,  
fixation  impact  for  each
group was normally distributed, as assessed by Shapiro–Wilk’s test (FD: 0.250 >

0.05 and FI: 0.301 > 0.05), and there was homogeneity of variances, as assessed
by Levene’s test for equality of variances (p = 0.867 > 0.05). The FI players 
had
greater  fixation  impact  towards  bonus  items  (M  =  22.139,  SD  =  7.277) 
 than
FD players (M = 14.279, SD = 5.890), a statistically significant difference, M =
7.860, 95% CI [-0.206, 15.513], t(12) = 2.237, p = 0.045 < 0.05.


4    Discussion and Interpretation

Eye–tracking analysis revealed significant differences between the game–playing
approaches of FD and FI individuals. There was a significant difference on both
fixation  count  and  fixation  impact  towards  the  interactive  game  
elements.  FI
players had greater fixation count and fixation impact than FD players, a 
finding
that was anticipated as FI individuals tend to focus more easily on details and
separate them from the background, whereas FD individuals are typically aware
of       the whole field, paying less attention to details [9][26]. Therefore, 
the FI players
looked more times and for longer time periods at the interactive game elements,
and they interacted more times with them [21][22].

Focusing on the different types of the game elements, no significant difference
was  found  on  the  fixation  count  and  fixation  impact  towards  helpful  
objects.
Since,  the  collection  of  such  objects  was  mandatory  in  order  for  the 
 players
to  proceed  and  complete  the  game,  the  fact  that  no  differences  
between  FD
and FI players observed was anticipated. However, there was a significant effect
regarding the fixation count and fixation impact toward bonus items. FD players
observed less times and for shorter time periods the bonus items, as they tend
to  follow a more intrinsic approach and be less inclined in detecting details 
[26],
having in mind to complete the game faster [22]. On the other hand, FI players
tend  to  develop  self–defined  goals  and  be  more  analytical  [26],  and  
thus  they
observed bonus items more often and for longer time periods.

In both cases, the fact that FI players had greater fixation count and fixation
impact  towards  bonus  elements  than  FD  players,  would  lead  them  to  
interact
with these elements more often [21][22] and thus the game would provide them
more  information  about  Aztec  civilisation.  Therefore,  FI  players  would  
more
likely get involved in learning activities by acquiring information related to 
Aztec
history, while FD players would process less information. Design wise there is a
risk  for game designers of unintentionally favouring players with specific 
cogni-
tive styles. Therefore, cognitive differences should play a role in both the 
design
and  the  play  phase  of  the  games.  Our  study  reinforces  the  belief  
that  FI/FD
users  develop  different  gaming  strategies  and  suggests  that  research  
on  play-
ers cognitive styles could reveal a lot about their interacting behaviour during
game play. Hence, designing games that implicitly recognise the users cognitive
style and adapts seem to be engraving a new promising path, especially in new
emerging environments, such as augmented and virtual reality, where embedding
eye-tracking mechanisms is feasible.

In terms of generalisability, we expect that similar effects will derive in 
differ-
ent game genres as long as they involve information processing tasks. In 
cultural
heritage contexts, given the large diversity of the visitors in terms of 
culture and
the   fact that there is a correlation between the culture and the different 
cognitive
skills and styles [6][13], we believe that adaptive and personalising mechanisms
should be proposed, to ensure better visiting experience for all audiences.


5    Conclusion

The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  effects  of  FD/FI  
cognitive  style
on gamers’ visual attention when playing a cultural heritage game. A main ef-
fect  of  cognitive  differences  on  the  fixation  count  and  fixation  
impact  towards
interactive game elements was found. In particular, FI players had greater fix-
ation count and fixation impact towards the total game elements and elements
that were not crucial for completing the game. On the other hand, no effect was
found regarding the fixation count and fixation impact towards objects that were
mandatory to be collected by the players in order to proceed in the game. Our
study   had limitations such as the rather small sample and the non–varying par-
ticipants’ profiles. However, its distribution was normal towards GEFT scores,
reflecting the general public distribution. The participants’ age range was also
limited,  but  taking  into  consideration  that  high–level  cognitive  
characteristics
rarely  change  throughout  adult  lifespan  [25],  the  observed  main  
effects  of  the
eye–tracking  study  would  possibly  apply  for  other  age  groups.  In  our  
sample
there      was an imbalance in terms of gender distribution, which was not 
reflected
to  the  GEFT  scores  as  they  followed  a  normal  distribution.  
Researchers  have
argued  for  and  against  a  correlation  between  the  gender  and  the  
FD/FI  clas-
sification  [11][12];  the  analysis  of  our  results  has  not  revealed  any 
 correlation
between  the  two.  Nonetheless  more  intensive  research  should  be  
conducted  in
order   to  gain  a  deeper  understanding  on  how  cognitive  factors  are  
related  to
players’ visual attention in games on a cultural heritage context.
