Abstract This paper investigates the effect that smart routing and
recommendations can have on improving the Quality of Experience of museum
visitors. The novelty of our approach consists of taking into account not only user
interests but also their visiting styles, as well as modeling the museum not as a
sterile space but as a location where crowds meet and interact, impacting each
visitor’s Quality of Experience. The investigation is done by an empirical study on
data gathered by a custom-made simulator tailored for the museum user routing
problem. Results are promising and future potential and directions are discussed.

1. Introduction
Museums; places people visit for learning, socialization and entertainment purposes.
Visitors want to leave the museum having purposefully spent their time there. In
parallel, museums typically have a variety of items on exhibition. What each visitor is
interested in seeing varies and it can be related to their interests, learning targets,
available time, as well as on other factors such as the size of the museum.
A problem often faced by museum visitors is that they often do not fully profit
from their visiting experience. That is, in the course of their visit, visitors may lose
time viewing items that do not interest them and miss those that do, due to time
restrictions or simply to the tiredness that inevitably occurs during visits.
Missing important exhibits and viewing items that the visitor is not so much
interested in may significantly lower visitor’s experience. Therefore, a need exists to
improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of museum visitors through intelligent
recommendations that will route visitors inside the museum towards exhibits of interest,
while, in parallel, minimizing the visitors’ walking time within the museum. Such an
approach would contribute towards shifting the museum from a static exhibition space
to what we may call an Intelligent Environment, designed to assist and improve the
overall experience of the visitor. Finally, it is also very important to examine the

routing and recommendations given in the context of the museum, i.e. taking into
account the particularities of the behavior of museum visitors, which are different than
a generic crowd’s behaviour.
1.1The Experimedia BLUE project
Experimedia BLUE2, is a research project funded by the European Commission, to
examine the above. Specifically, in Experimedia BLUE we are interested in
augmenting museum visitor experience by designing intelligent recommendation
algorithms that will offer a personalized visit to museum visitors according to their
interests, the type of visitor that they are, but also to their personality. The
experimentation setting of the project is the FHW3 museum, a technological museum
situated in Athens, Greece.
Briefly, the idea is as follows: visitors can play a Facebook game, prior to their
visit, which allows us to identify, with different degrees of accuracy, their interests on
the museum exhibition items and themes. During their visit, we provide visitors with
handheld devices that allow us to deliver recommendations over which item to visit
next, but also to monitor the visitors’ movement within the physical space of the
museum, thus detecting their visiting style. Visiting style is an important factor
reflecting people’s behavior when they are inside a museum and its detection can allow
us to calibrate the recommendation algorithms specifically for the museum’s context.
After the visit, people can share their experiences through social media. Given that
different museum visitors are expected to have different levels of interest for the
exhibits, different walking patterns and visiting styles, and spend varying amounts of
time on exhibitions, the first thing that we wish to explore in the BLUE project, prior to
any experimentation with real users, is the degree to which intelligent
recommendations can improve the visitors’ QoE, considering all the parameters above.
1.2 Our contribution
In this paper we investigate the potential and limitations that intelligent
recommendations have on the QoE of museum visitors, when designed to optimize the
latter for interesting exhibit identification and walking time minimization. We design a
smart recommendation algorithm and examine its expected performance for different
levels of noise in the estimation of user interests. Most importantly, given that museum
visitors are divided into visiting styles, we also examine the effect that such intelligent
recommendations have on each visiting style, in order to identify possible approaches,
and their context, for further QoE improvements, for the specific problem of museum
visit augmentation.
The difference of the BLUE approach with current approaches that use intelligent
recommendations to route crowds is that typically these focus on non-museum
applications such as building evacuation plans. The approaches that focus on museums
usually treat them as generic physical spaces and do not take into account the visiting
styles of the visitors to optimize user routing. In addition the works on optimizing user
routing inside museums(indicatively [12]) usually report few quantitative results, while
they do not examine factors such as noise in visitor interest estimation.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the related
literature and positions the present work within it. Section 3 presents the modeling of

developed and used. Section 4 presents the experimental evaluation. Finally, section 5

2. Related Literature
2.1 Indoor localisation systems and location-based services
With the rise of GPS [6], localisation services have become very popular and seen a
multitude of services, making good use of localisation systems, made readily available
[14]. However, there is an inverse relation between the availability of the service and
the need for the service as the structures we build create a shadow that cannot be
penetrated by current GPS technology. Indoor localisation technologies have been
developed to remedy the situation. They come in two categories: the first relies on the
installation of an additional infrastructure [4; 9] while the second category aims at
exploiting existing infrastructures [1; 16]. Indoor locations have since seen tailored
services being developed [7]. In the scenario investigated in this paper, as well as in the
BLUE project, indoor localisation technologies are to be used to capture museum
visitor’s positions, track their movement through a museum, and issue
recommendations on their optimal path through the museum based on the visitors’
personal preferences and interests.
2.2 Scenario-based user routing optimisation
In contrast to outdoor localisation systems which benefit from a very homogenous
setting roads and paths are well defined and delimited clearly; indoor localisation is a
bit trickier. Only part of the navigable space, notably corridors, is clearly defined.
Therefore, indoor maps need to be enhanced, for example semantic information[5], to
increase routing and navigation accuracy and flexibility. This will in turn enable indoor
scenarios to take into account more diverse mobility types and develop specialised
scenarios, e.g. for individuals with reduced mobility [8]. Due to its GPS-based scenario
legacy, localisation systems focus on mobility scenarios given by physical mobility
types and offer standard optimisation options (e.g. fastest, shortest) but do not account
for individual’s preferences, in regard to experience, to navigate spaces. However,
Quality of Experience (QoE) is paramount when the objective is to experience an
environment rather than merely navigating it.
Enhancing experiences through the use of technology is often proposed by using
readily available, familiar, and easy to use devices. For example, the works of Andolina
et al. [2] and Tesoriero et al. [15] make use of mobile devices to optimize cultural
heritage visitor’s experience by improvements to presentation, interaction, and
integration. Unfortunately, they leave the potential for QoE improvement by interestoptimized visitor routing untapped. The work of van Hage et al. [3] approaches this
problem by proposing to detect user preferences and compute a personalized visit,
optimized by walking distance and the art objects that each visitor perceives as
interesting. Roes et al. [11; 12] build upon the previous work by maintaining a dynamic
user model and enriching the available palette of experiences by going online. However,
the above works do not specify important elements such as the interest estimation
accuracy and the effect that this has on the performance of the routing algorithm, nor
do they take into account visitor’s personalities, through their visiting styles, for the
development of the recommendation and routing strategy. We think the latter are

510

especially crucial, and complementary to interests, for providing relevant
recommendations especially tailored for museum visitors.
In this paper we examine the effect that intelligent recommendations have on the
Quality of Experience of museum visitors, for differentiated conditions of the involved
visitor population (i.e. behavioral/movement patterns of the visitors, differentiated
interests and crowd tolerance limits), and different noise levels of the input interest
estimation algorithm.

3. Methodology
We use agent-based modeling to model the behaviour of the visitors inside the
museum, as well as the museum’s physical space. Below we describe the modeling
performed, as well as the recommendation algorithm to be examined.
3.1 Basic Element Modeling
Museum
The museum is modeled as a set of  exhibits ݁௜ ൌ ሾ݁ଵ ǡ ݁ଶ ǡ ǥ ǡ ݁௡ ሿ . Each exhibit
represents one exhibit inside the museum. Each exhibit ୧ is modelled to have a:
x Maximum crowd capacity ୧ , which corresponds to the maximum number of
people that can simultaneously visit the exhibit ୧ . For example, in the case of
a painting, M would mean the maximum number of people that can gather
around and see the exhibit, while in the case of an exhibit that is a videoprojection room, M would mean the maximum number of seats available.
Each exhibit also belongs to one museum room. Therefore exhibits can either be
co-located in the same room or they can be located in different rooms. Each exhibit is
“connected”, i.e. accessible via walking, to all the exhibits of the same room. Also, in
this specific modeling, each room has one exhibit connected to the museum entrance,
as this is the case for FHW (all exhibition rooms are accessible directly from the
entrance without the need to pass from other rooms first). A room may be connected,
always through exactly one exhibit, to another room. To model the above, we define:
x An ȁȁ ൈ ȁȁexhibit positioning matrix  ൌ ሾଵଵ ǡ ǥ ǡ ȁ୉ȁȁ୉ȁ ሿ. Each element୧୩ of
the positioning matrix P can be defined as follows:

where  is the distance of exhibits within the same room, and ୖ is the distance
between rooms, which is taken as the distance between the two exhibits connectingthe
rooms. Finally, for each room we also define inside each room a pseudo-exhibit, which
serves as the room’s center and will be used for the modeling of the movement of
certain visitor types (detailed in section 3.2).

The positioning matrix is used to find the connections between items of the same
room and between rooms and the distance matrix is used to calculate the path distances.
These two matrices can be given, if we want to experiment on a specific museum
setting, or they can be generated using the following four parameters: 1) min and max
exhibits distances for the exhibits of the same room, 2) min and max room distances 3)
number of total rooms in museum and 4) number of exhibits per room. The simulation
described here use the above 4 parameters to generate museum settings.
Visitor
Visitors are modeled to arrive to the museum with an inter-arrival rateρ, randomly
distributed between two time parameters: ρ୫୧୬ ൑ ρ ൑ ρ୫ୟ୶ .
Each visitor j has the following characteristics:
x Interest per Exhibit ୣ౟ౠ , Ͳ ൑ ୣ౟ౠ ൑ ͳ , where ୣ౟ౠ is a Real number and the
bounds 0 and 1 mean respectively no interest or perfect interest for exhibit i.
x Crowd Tolerance ୧୨ . The number of other people that the visitor can handle
around exhibit i, without a decrease of his satisfaction from the visit. It is
modeled per exhibit, as a percentage of the maximum crowd capacity of the
latter, i.e.: ‫ܥ‬௜௝ ൌ ‫݌‬௜௝ ȉ ‫ܯ‬௜ , where ‫ܯ‬௜ is the maximum capacity of exhibit ݅.
x Maximum available Time ୨ , in minutes. The time that the user can spend
inside the museum. The simulator starts counting the moment the visitor
enters. Once it is over, the visitor exits the museum.
x Walking speed ୨ , simulated in meters/second. Will be used to calculate the
time needed to go to an exhibit, in the QoE function.
x Time spent per Exhibit  ୣ౟ౠ . We assume that the time each user will spend
seeing each exhibit is a function of their interest for that exhibit:
 ୣ౟ౠ ൌ ݂ሺ ୣ౟ౠ ሻ
, where݂is defined separately for each visitor type, and described in detail in
section 3.2. Regarding time, each visitor also has a ݉ܽ‫ ݁݉݅ܶݐܾ݄݅݅ݔܧݔ‬and
݉݅݊‫ ݁݉݅ܶݐܾ݄݅݅ݔܧ‬correspond respectively to the overall maximum and
minimum times that the user can spend on one exhibit.
x QoE. Each user has a Quality of Experience metric. This measures how
satisfied the user is from his visit inside the museum. We can intuitively
assume that for each item the user visits, his QoE is proportional to the user’s
interest on the item, and inversely proportional to the time it took him to reach
the exhibit. Therefore, for a user that is currently at exhibit ୩ and he is going
to exhibit ୧ , we model ୣ౟ౠ as follows:
ୣ౟ౠ ൌ ଵ ȉ

3.2 Visiting styles modeling
Apart from the above basic characteristics, each museum visitor belongs to one of 4
distinct visiting styles described using animal metaphors (ant, butterfly, fish or
grasshopper).Each visiting style corresponds to a specific movement pattern of the
visitor inside the physical space of the museum. Including the visiting styles into the
modeling renders the simulations more tailored to the specific context of museum visit
applications and further supports its reliability in supporting decision-making based on
the simulation results. For the modeling of the visiting styles we use two literature
studies. The first, the work of Veron and Levasseur [10] describes visiting styles from a
behavioral perspective. The second, work of Sookhanaphibarn and Thawonmas [13], is
among the few who perform a mathematical modeling of each visiting style, limited
however only to one exhibition room and using x, y coordinates instead of a graphbased model that we employ. In the following we extend the aforementioned modeling
to fit the graph-based model that we use.
Ant
Ant visitors move linearly, visiting almost all exhibits, showing interest in the detail,
avoiding empty spaces and following a clear path and the curator’s suggestions. In
modeling terms, the ant visitor visits the exhibits of each room sequentially, choosing
the each time closest not-visited exhibit until all exhibits of the room have been visited.
The ant’s interest ୣ౟ౠ , with ݅ the exhibit and ݆ the visitor, is given by a normal
distribution, in the [0,10] range and mean equal to 5. Also, the ant has very low interest
for room centers, meaning that Ant visitors do not frequently pass from these points but
they rather visit exhibits in a linear fashion. The time spent per exhibit is ‫ݐ‬௘೔ೕ ൌ
಴
ିఘ൬ ೔ ൰

݂ ቀ‫ܫ‬௘೔ೕ ቁ ൌ  ‫ܫ‬௘೔ೕ ȉ ݁ ಾ೔ , where݆ is the visitor,‫ܥ‬௜ is the current crowd around the exhibit
i, ‫ܯ‬௜ is the maximum crowd capacity of the exhibit and ߩ is a weighted constant used
as defined in [13].
Fish
Fish visitors move in the center of rooms, seeking to see the “larger” picture, not
approaching most exhibits and not stopping very frequently. Their interest ୣ౟ౠ is
modeled the same as that of ants, with the difference that a Fish visitor has also very
high interest for room centers. This means that Fish visitors will spend a lot of their
time and pass often from room centers and then, visit certain exhibits according to their
interest. Fish also are modeled to return to the center after each exhibit visit and after
exiting a room, they choose not to visit the centers of rooms that they have visited, to
avoid eternal loops in their movement pattern (induced by their high interest for centers
rather than for any other exhibit in each room). The time spent per exhibit for the Fish
is  ୣ౟ౠ ൌ ݂ ቀ

513

Grasshopper
Grasshopper visitors are persons of particular interests, they only approach certain
exhibits, cross empty spaces and spend a significant amount of time in front of items of
interest. To model those exhibits that are of interest for the Grasshopper, we use a Beta
PDF distribution with ߛ ൌ ͳ and ߚ ൌ ͷ, as in [13]. Then applying a threshold ‫ܮ‬, we
select the exhibits that the Grasshopper will be interested in. For these exhibits, we
model an interest ୣ౟ౠ , given by a Gaussian distribution but with a mean very close to 1,
to model the very high interest that the Grasshopper has on these exhibits. For the rest
of the exhibits, the Grasshopper has 0 interest. The time that the Grasshopper spends
per exhibit is also affected by the above-selected exhibits as follows:
಴
ିఘ൬ ೔ ൰

‫ ܫ‬ȉ ݁ ಾ೔ ǡ ݂݅‫ܫ‬௘೔ೕ ൐ ‫ܮ‬
(5)
‫ݐ‬௘೔ೕ ൌ ቐ ௘೔ೕ
Ͳǡ ݂݅‫ܫ‬௘೔ೕ ൏ ‫ܮ‬
, where L is the threshold on the Beta distribution, and the rest of the parameters
are defined as in the previous.
Butterfly
Butterfly visitors move nonlinearly, they do not follow the curator’s suggestions, they
often change the direction of their movement, approach exhibits, are interested in the
detail and are affected by environmental affordances, such as the accessibility of the
exhibit. The Butterfly visitor is modeled to also present a selective exhibit probability,
like the case of the Grasshopper, but on the inverse, i.e. a Butterfly is interested in most
of the exhibits. To model the exhibits of interest for the Butterfly we use a Beta PDF
distribution with ߛ ൌ ͷ and ߚ ൌ ͳ, as in [13]. Again placing a threshold ‫ܮ‬, low this
time, we define the exhibits that the Butterfly has interest in. The exhibits underneath
this threshold present a 0 interest for the Butterfly. For the selected exhibits we use a
Gaussian distribution with mean equal to 7. The time that the Butterfly spends per
exhibit is defined to be similar to that of the ant for those exhibits with ‫ܫ‬௘೔ೕ ൐ ‫ܮ‬and 0
otherwise.
3.3 Modeled Systems
We model two systems implementing two kinds of visitor behaviour in the museum:
x Simple visit. Visitors enter the museum and select exhibits to see, according to
their visiting style. For each visitor, if the exhibit he/she selects has reached its
maximum crowd capacity‫ܯ‬௜ , or it has more visitors than the crowd tolerance
limit of the specific visitor, then he/she moves to another exhibit. For going
from one exhibit to the other, visitors always take the shortest path. The
resulting simulated system, with its 4 subsystems (one for each visiting style)
is referred to as the “no recommendation” system and serves as the
benchmark.
x Recommendation-based visit. Visitors in this system are given exhibit
recommendations, through a recommendation algorithm (described later on).
In case the algorithm recommends them an exhibit for which their estimated
interest is above 7 (in a scale of 10): ୣ౟ౠ ൐ ͹ , then they follow the
recommendation. Otherwise they behave like in the random system, i.e. they
randomly select an exhibit. It should be noted that the algorithms makes its

514

I. Lykourentzou et al. / Improving Museum Visitors’ QoE Through Intelligent Recommendations

recommendations based on the estimated interest of the user, which is
modeled as the real interest of the user plus noise. The noise, which basically
models the approximation error that the algorithm will have in reality, is set
by the "noise "parameter of the simulator, as a range between two numbers,
each in the scale of [0,10], since interest is also measured in this scale. Then
before each recommendation, the algorithm selects a random number in the
range set for the noise and adds/subtracts it from the real user interest. This
estimated value is the one used for the recommendation decisions of the
algorithm. Example: Assume we set noise to be in the [1,2] range and a user
with real interest 7/10. This means that the best possible approximation of this
user's interest is 7S1 and the worst possible is 7S2. Therefore the algorithm
estimates the user's interest as a random number in the [5,6] or in the [8,9]
ranges. The recommendation algorithm used in the specific paper is as
follows:
o

“Smart” algorithm. The algorithm optimizes for the QoE function, as
given in eq. (4). This is the classical content-based recommendation
scheme where the recommender takes into account user interests and
walking time to try to maximize the user satisfaction.

4. Experimental evaluation
In the following we present certain preliminary results, derived from simulating an
environment that features the modeling presented above. The modeling parameters
chosen for the specific experimental evaluation, and for the purposes of the BLUE
project, are illustrated in Table 1.

4.1Results
First we measure the QoE between the simple and smart systems, for different levels of
recommendation noise (i.e. the error between an ideal recommendation and the one
actually provided by the system). This first scenario answers the basic question of
whether a QoE-based recommendation increases the QoE of the visitors and, if so, by
how much. The recommendation algorithm being deployed in the FHW museum will

I. Lykourentzou et al. / Improving Museum Visitors’ QoE Through Intelligent Recommendations

515

inevitably have an approximation error (regarding its estimation of user interest per
exhibit). Therefore, this scenario mirrors the QoE improvements that we expect when
accounting for the algorithm’s approximation error.
As we can see in Figure 1, the recommendation noise directly affects the level of
visitor QoE, for all 4 types of visitors, since it affects the accuracy of the
recommendation algorithm. In other words, the more inaccurate the algorithm’s
estimations, the lower its final average visitor QoE, This is expected as QoE is
computed from the fulfillment of user interests. The very high levels of noise, for
example above7, of the Figure correspond to the “worst case scenario” accuracy error
that may be encountered for visitors that have not used the Facebook game and,
therefore, their profiles are unknown to the algorithm when they first enter the museum.
As they gradually move and respond to recommendations, we can expect that the
recommendation algorithm’s accuracy error will drop. However, in both cases (for high
and low noise) we observe that the visitor’s QoE is higher than the previously
established baseline, where visitors move based only on their visiting type without any
recommendations.
Other interesting results can be observed when examining the gain in QoE for each
visiting style on its own. As we have observed, the type of visitor that can be expected
to receive the highest improvement of experience is the Fish (Fig. 1a), followed by the
Ant (Fig. 1b). Butterfly type visitors (Fig.1d) and Grasshoppers in particular (Fig. 1c),
only show a slight, to almost no improvement in QoE when a recommendation
algorithm is used. This can be explained by the fact that Fish, typically moving in the
center of the exhibition rooms, may accidentally “miss” many exhibition items. Hence,
directing them towards specific items of interest significantly improves their overall
QoE. The same goes for Ants and Butterflies, although to a lesser extent, as these
visitors show, inherently, a more uniform distribution of interest for items inside the
museum. Finally Grasshoppers, being visitors that have a very high interest in very
specific exhibits, will visit these exhibits regardless of the external conditions of the
museum space (e.g. other visitors) or interest-based recommendations.

Figure 1. Quality of Experience achieved with and without recommendations

Figure 2 depicts the number of missed exhibits for different ranges of noise in the
recommendation algorithm’s estimations. Missed exhibits are those that the visitor is
very interested in (internal interest > 7 on a scale of10) but that he does not see because
they are not recommended by the algorithm due to high estimation noise. As expected,
the higher the noise, the higher the number of lost exhibits. However, we also observe
that, at all noise levels, the recommendation-based system does not result in a
significantly lower number of missed exhibits, thus the loss of QoE for visitors, even at
high levels of approximation error, is acceptable.
Analyzing the results per visitor type we witness the same pattern as before,, i.e.
that Fish are expected to benefit the most from the recommendation of exhibits by the
smart algorithm, while Grasshoppers benefit the least. Ants and Butterflies innately
miss very few exhibits, with Ants seeming to benefit the most, among the two visiting
styles.

5. Discussion, Future Work and Conclusion
In this paper we examine the effect that intelligent recommendations (designed to
improve QoE and reduce walking time) have on the QoE of visitors belonging to the 4
prevalent behavioral and movement patterns that literature gives us for museum visitors.
To do so, we model in detail the museum setting, the behavioral and movement
patterns of museum visitors, including their visiting styles, as well as the
recommendation algorithm. We then examine, through simulation evaluation, the effect
of the algorithm on the QoE on the visitors. Experimental results show that Fish is the
type of visitors that can benefit the most, since their QoE considerably improves after
receiving interest-based routing recommendations. Ants and Butterflies can also be
helped although not as extensively as the Fish. The Grasshopper is the type expected to
profit the least from such an algorithm, mainly because Grasshoppers know a priori
which exhibits they would like to see, regardless of interest estimation or distance. The
noise in the estimation of visitor interests was found to play an important role in the
efficiency of visitor routing, further supporting the need for accurate a priori interest
estimations like the one we use in the BLUE project through the Facebook game
visitors can play before visiting. Noise, however, even at very high levels, was not
found to worsen QoE when compared to giving no recommendations. This is positive,
as it can provide more flexibility in experimentation with various recommendation
strategies.
Having a good base for the modeling and simulation of the 4 different visitor’s
types, in the future we would like to develop and examine recommendation algorithms
that are tailored and adapted to each style separately. Perhaps in this way we may
achieve further improvement on visiting types like the Butterfly or the Grasshopper
that seem to experience a low benefit from the generic interest-based recommendation
algorithm used in this paper. Another interesting data point would be to measure the
QoE not per visitor but per exhibit to examine the distribution of user “satisfaction”
with each exhibit. This could allow museum curators to optimize their exhibitions by
potentially re-arranging exhibit items within the physical space of the museum,
according to the visitor types that the museum most often hosts. We also plan to
examine visitors’ response to recommendations when museums of different size and
exhibit density are concerned. Furthermore, we intend to extend the present work to

mixed crowd scenarios (populations of different visiting styles, or populations where
some visitors receive recommendations and others do not), as well as on visitor groups
(such as families of school classes) rather only on individual visitors. Validation with
real users in a selected museum scenario is also envisaged.
Finally, it would be interesting to observe the effect that crowd congestion has on
the QoE of the different visiting styles. We are currently examining the algorithm’s
response in relation to different congestion levels inside the museum, in order to come
up with intelligent routing algorithms that optimize the visitors’ QoE for congestion as
well.
