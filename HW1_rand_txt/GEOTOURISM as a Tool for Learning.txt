Abstract: “Geotourism” is a particular type of “sustainable tourism” that is still in an embryonic
stage, especially in Italy. The main goal is the transmission of geological knowledge to increase the
awareness about geoheritage, geo-resources and geo-hazards. The geoparks represent ideal sites,
with a strong educational significance for students, teachers, geo-tourists, and guides interested in
geological and environmental sciences, though at different levels. With this in mind, we propose a
geoitinerary through some of the most geologically interesting coastal areas in the Cilento, Vallo di
Diano, and Alburni Geopark. The aim of the geoitinerary is to provide a good example of how
geosites could be promoted through geotourism and used as means of divulgation of geological
and environmental knowledge. The selected sites are the San Marco coast, the Licosa Cape and the
Elea-Velia archaeological area. They are included in the official list of geosites and geomorphosites
of the Geopark and have a relevant stratigraphic and geoarcheological value. The San Marco coast
and the Licosa Cape are the “best sites” in the Geopark where Quaternary coastal deposits and
morphologies are represented. The Elea-Velia site is one of the most famous archeological sites in the
Geopark, which is also representative of complex human-environment interactions. Despite their
high scientific significance, the sites that we have selected are not included in a specific promoting
program. We have so tried to fill this gap by providing the scientific background for their geotouristic
promotion that could also serve as an instrument for the increase of the local economy.
Keywords: geoparks; geosites; geotourism; geological knowledge; geoarcheology

1. Introduction
The Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park was founded in 1991 under the law 394/91 and it was
included in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World
Heritage list in 1998. It gained the title of Geopark in 2010 and became a UNESCO Global Geopark
in 2015. Global Geoparks have been defined as “Single, unified geographical areas where sites and
landscapes of international geological significance are managed with a holistic concept of protection,
education and sustainable development” [1,2]. Several authors [3–6] suggested, among the main
purposes of a geopark, the preservation of geodiversity by means of geoeducation and geotourism.
Geological education, that is, how geoscience, particularly the geological processes, and society are
linked, is a basic resource for the social and economic development of any community because it

increases the sensitivity and awareness of citizens in the respect of the environmental estate and natural
disasters. Unfortunately, geological education is still a missing topic [7] as, for instance, in the context
of global change and overexploitation of resources [8]. Reference [9] suggests that, by using geological
themes significant to the public through interpretive media and educational packages, it is possible to
create a “dialogue between the public and Earth’s history”, leading people towards an understanding
of the important processes that control our planet. In this meaning, Geoparks and Geoturism may be
very useful. According to several authors ([10–12] and references therein) “Geotourism” is an emerging
type of sustainable tourism, which focuses on geosites and furnishes visitor knowledge, environmental
education, and also amusement.
In this paper, we propose a geoitinerary along the Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni Geopark
coastal area, with the aim to provide a good example of how some geosites and geomorphosites could
be promoted through geotourism and used as means of geological and environmental knowledge
divulgation. Geologists always use field activity as a tool to teach their students; our goal is to
demonstrate that the experience of coming directly in touch with a geological subject may be the
most effective approach also for non-expert people. The coastal area of the Cilento Vallo di Diano
and Alburni Geopark includes several geomorphosites, which represent good examples of both
coastal features and evidence of past sea level fluctuations that occurred in response to global
climate change. Several papers have already stressed the importance of increased awareness about
climate change in coastal environments, also suggesting geotourism as a key action to reach this
goal [13–17]. Coastal zones are typical examples of dynamic and sensitive environments, which evolve
through different phenomena that act at different temporal and spatial scales [18]. They represent
the interface where the land meets the sea and include river deltas, coastal plains, wetlands, beaches
and dunes, reefs, lagoons, cliffs and other coastal features. All these areas are very sensitive to
changes in response to sea-level rise or extreme weather events, which may cause or accelerate
coastal erosion and retreat [19–21]. Approximately 60% of the world’s population lives along coastal
zones [22,23], which often represent a major environmental and economic resource, though under
risk in the light of the present climatic trend [23] that is enhancing the naturally induced sea level
rise. We planned a geoitinerary focused on the geological and geomorphological evidence (namely,
sediments and landforms) of both the active dynamics and past sea level fluctuations along various
coastal environments of the Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni Geopark. Our aim was to give an
example of how geomorphosites may be useful for educational purposes and providing teachers and
touristic guides with didactic/explanatory material.
We selected some sites among those listed in the Geopark’s geosites and geomorphosites inventory,
choosing the ones with the following requirements: representativeness, availability, and potential
educational approach. For each site, we chose one or more geological and geomorphological topics
that are represented at the “best” and explained them in the simplest way, with the aim to transfer their
scientific significance to an audience as wide as possible. To reach our educational goal, we followed
the suggestions of Macadam [24], i.e.,: (i) choosing the message we want the tourists bring home,
(ii) avoiding geological jargon, (iii) using more pictures and figures than words. In particular, we focused
on the following messages:
(i)

(ii)

We want to make the tourists aware that natural environments are not static in space and time,
but they may evolve and thus interact with human activities. The selected sites are excellent
places to spread this message that could have a strong influence on people worldwide because
coastal hazard phenomena are spread all over the world.
We want the tourists to become aware that the climate on Earth changed periodically, causing
sea level fluctuations and, consequently, significant modifications to coastal environments.
Understanding past climate changes and their effects on the environment may help to understand
the present and future climate changes. It should be the occasion to reflect on natural induced
climate changes and to become aware that in the postglacial period we are now living in,
the human-induced climate changes are contributing to quicken the natural ones.

2. Study Area
2.1. Geological Setting
The Cilento, Vallo di Diano, and Alburni Geopark is bounded by the Sele River plain to the north,
the Vallo di Diano and the Tanagro River valley to the north-east, the Gulf of Policastro to the south,
and the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west (Figure 1). The Cilento region is part of the Southern Apennines,
a NE-directed fold and thrust belt developed in Neogene to Quaternary times [25–27]. At the surface,
the mountain belt consists of both open marine Mesozoic stratigraphic units and continental margin
successions composed of platform carbonates and pelagic deposits, covered by Neogene and late
Miocene wedge-top basin clastics [28–30]. Due to the heterogeneous nature of outcropping rocks and
its rugged topography, the Geopark is characterized by a very high degree of geodiversity [31,32].
Carbonate massifs with summit karst landscapes, bounded by steep structural slopes, are typical of the
inner area of the park (Figure 1). In such ridges, karst cave systems associated with the most important
underground water reservoirs of the region are preserved [33–35]. The carbonate massifs alternate
with a hilly landscape, with gentle slopes and dendritic drainage pattern, where pelagic and clastic
successions dominate [36–40]. They are represented by the Cilento Group deposits (age between 17.7
and 10.8 million years), with the Pollica and S. Mauro Formations, mainly made up of alternating
sandstones, marls and puddingstones [41–43]. The basinal successions (age between 65 and 22 million
years) are well exposed in the southern part of the study area (Ascea-Velia) and are made up of the
Crete Nere formation, dark clayey successions more than 500 m thick [36,44]. All these units have been
involved in the complex tectonic history leading to the formation of the Southern Apennine chain,
and for this reason they appear strongly deformed by fault and fold systems [37,45]. During Quaternary
times (last 2.6 million years), the study area emerged from the sea, and its landscape was shaped by
the actions of different geomorphic processes (fluvial, coastal, aeolian) under the control of strong
climate variations. Continental and marine Quaternary succession, mainly made up by conglomerates
and sandstones, accumulated along the valleys of the main rivers (Alento, Mingardo and Bussento
rivers) and along the coast in the areas of Santa Maria di Castellabate and San Marco di Castellabate
(hereinafter and in the map of Figure 1 labelled Santa Maria and San Marco, respectively), Palinuro
and Marina di Camerota [46–54]. Different kinds of geosites (structural, stratigraphic, paleontological,
geomorphological) [55,56] are witnesses of this significant geological heritage and have been listed
in the geosites inventory of the Geopark [57]. The latter includes 160 geosites, 36% of which with
main stratigraphical, paleontological, and geological value, and 54% of which are considered as
geomorphosites. Nevertheless, at ~30 years from the National Park foundation and 10 years from the
Geopark recognition, the actions aiming at the promotion and divulgation of the geological estate of
the area are still very few [34,35,40,58–63].

3. Materials and Methods
For the selection of sites, we followed the suggestions of Brilha [68], who states that sites with high
potential educational value (EV) are those that have geological features that can be easily understood
by students of different levels of education, with comfortable and quick access and where students
may observe the site under good safety conditions. Similarly, sites with potential tourism value (TV)
are those presenting visual beauty enjoyable by the majority of the public, with geological features that
can be easily observed and understood by non-specialists, under good safety conditions, and with
comfortable and quick access. Therefore, we have followed the Brilha [68] method to assess both
the educational (Table 1) and the touristic (Table 2) values of coastal geosites in the Cilento, Vallo di
Diano and Alburni Geopark. Moreover, to select the geosites that could be included in the geoitinerary,
we analyzed the official list of the geosites of the Geopark reported in Aloia et al. [61] and we selected
all the geosites placed along the coastal area that could be considered representative of sea level
variations. According to Brilha [68], the educational value of a geosite derives from the sum of the
relative scores of twelve indicators and their weights, which are the vulnerability (V), accessibility
(AC), use limitations (UL), safety (SA), logistics (L), density of population (DE), association with other
values (AS), scenery (SC), uniqueness (UN), observation conditions (OC), didactic potential (DP) and
geological diversity (GD). Similarly, the touristic value of a geosite derives from the same indicators of
the educational value and their relative weights, with the exception of DP and GD that are replaced
by the interpretative potential (IP), economic level (EL), and proximity of recreational areas (RA).
Using the criteria listed above, we selected three geosites that gained the highest score of both indexes
(Section 4), which are the San Marco site, the marine terrace of Punta Licosa, and the Elea-Velia site.
In particular, the San Marco site can be considered as the best outcrop of Quaternary coastal deposits
with well-preserved sedimentary structures along the entire coast of the Geopark, notwithstanding the
presence of other important coastal sites and outcrops [46,51,52,54]. Moreover, the San Marco site is
also explicative for the dynamics of rocky coasts and in particular for the formation and evolution
of the sea cliffs. The Licosa cape is the best example of a marine terrace in the area of the Geopark.
The Licosa cape marine terrace covers an area of more than 4 km in length and up to 500 m in width and
has been the object of several scientific publications [47,49,69]. The Elea-Velia site is the second most
important archaeological site in the Geopark, being only preceded by Paestum (Figure 1). Besides its
archaeological value, it is also exemplary for the human/environment interaction in a flat coastal area
characterised by coastline shifting [47,70–72].

The high didactic value of these sites makes them suitable for educational activities addressed to
the diffusion of environmental knowledge. With this in mind, we consulted all the available literature
data about these sites and tried to “translate” the main basic geological concepts to a wider audience,
not necessarily having a geological background. Taking into account the suggestions of UNESCO [73]
and Macadam [24], we tried to avoid the use of geological jargon, dumbing down the concepts but
without losing their scientific integrity. We used photos, sketches, maps, and 3-D reconstructions
accompanied by short and simple sentences to explain our messages. In particular, for each discussed
topic, we designed explanatory panels that can serve as a guideline [74–76] for both touristic guides
and science teachers at different educational levels. We conceived the panels with a design that could
be readable on the most common electronic devices (e.g., smartphone, tablets) thus making the panels
available for the users during the entire trip.
The 3-D views have been obtained from detail scale digital terrain models (DTM). The latter
includes Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data obtained by the Italian Minister of the Environment.
Lidar data have been imported in a Geographic Information System (GIS) software, Arcgis 10.7©
(Redlands, CA, USA), to derive a hillshade map that has been managed by means of the ArcScene
module to obtain the 3-D views. The latter have been obtained by applying a 3-times vertical
exaggeration and have been rotated, with respect the north, to obtain the point of view that allows the
best appreciation of the coastal landforms.
4. Results
4.1. Geosites Selection
The location of the geosites selected among those listed in the Geopark official list is reported in
Figure 2. The results of the application of the Brilha method [68] are reported in Table 1 (educational
use of the geosites) and Table 2 (touristic use of the geosites). Moreover, regarding the accessibility
indicator (AC), the selected geosites are often placed along the coasts (geosites n. 92, 93, 94, 96, 102 and
104) and they can be reached only by boats, so we have considered distances indicated by Brilha [68] as
distances from the closest harbour. As a result of the evaluation, three geosites gained the highest scores
in both indexes, which are the geosite n. 22–Marine terrace of Punta Licosa, geosite n. 24–Sandstones
of San Marco, and geosite n. 38–Elea-Velia. Consequently, we have selected these three geosites and
planned the educational geoitinerary.

We think that these simple concepts on the extreme dynamicity of the coastal environment and on
the past climate changes should be fundamental for the education of each citizen, from students to
administrators and politicians. We planned the geoitinerary trying to explain these main sea level
fluctuations, choosing one site for each peak described in Figure 3.

(coastal hazard) explains how the normal evolution of a cliff may interact with human activity causing
risk conditions for both human properties and lives.
This site is also representative because it preserves the best exposure along the coast of the Geopark
of ancient coastal marine sediments related to the Penultimate Interglacial (around 200,000 years
ago [55]) with well-preserved sedimentary structures (Figure 6). Looking at the cliff, even a casual
tourist may catch the spectacular geometric design drawn by the nature on this rock.
In particular, the cliff is made up of ancient coastal sands, which are now uplifted and form a
wide depositional terrace over which the village of San Marco is built (Figure 7). The good exposure
of well-preserved sedimentary structures makes this site significant for educational purposes for
geological science students. They may come in touch with sandstones and their textures and may
observe different kinds of sedimentary structures, testifying for a submerged beach environment.
Instead, around 200,000 years ago, the area now occupied by the village of San Marco was invaded by
the sea, becoming a gulf, and sands were deposited at the sea bottom. These sands now lie at 15–20 m
above the sea level, an altitude higher than the eustatic sea level related to the Penultimate Interglacial
(Figure 3). This means that the land moved upward (tectonic uplift) with respect to the sea and the
deposited sands emerged, forming the San Marco marine terrace. Geologists name this kind of marine
terrace as “raised marine terrace”.

at the eustatic sea level curve of the last 10,000 years (Figure 10), we may observe that there is a variation
in the rate of sea level rise at around 7000 years ago. Before that moment, the curve is very steep,
suggesting a very rapid sea level rise that resulted in a general submersion of flat coastal areas. For this
reason, when the Greeks colonized the territory, the Acropolis hill was a promontory bounded by two
gulfs, that extended in place of the present Alento (to the NW) and Fiumarella (to the SE) plains [48].
Active sea-cliffs were shaped along the rocky coasts, whereas in front of the flat alluvial-coastal plains,
sand ridges isolated lagoon environments that were suitable places for landing.
Why is the Acropolis hill now located hundreds of meters inland with respect to the present
coastline? The answer is in the complex interaction between coastal processes and sea level
fluctuations [81–83]. From 7000 years ago up to now, the rate of sea level rise decreased and was
compensated by the incessant sediment supply from inland (Figure 9). For this reason, the coastline
started to move towards the sea, and this phenomenon is called “coastal progradation”.

Stop 2: Via di Porta V
This stop allows the visitors to have a look at the sequence of alluvial fan deposits that damaged
the structures of the Southern Quarter all along the life of the Graeco-Roman town. The alluvial
deposits came from the erosion of the stream catchments cutting the slopes at the rear of the Southern
Quarter, within the town perimeter (Figure 11). The sedimentological characteristic of the alluvial
deposits exposed in the section (massive, badly sorted, and poorly stratified pebbles, sands, and silts)

clearly indicates that these alluvial events occurred mainly as debris flow, i.e., the water transported
high quantity of debris, behaving as a high-density fluid. The intensive fan deposition caused the town
abandonment after several phases of restoration. From that moment, a few other floods affected the
area up to the V century AD, when flooding was definitively interrupted [72,83].

5. Discussion and Conclusions
The objective of our work was to provide an example of how geosites, and in particular those with
high didactic value, may be used for educational purposes. Bearing in mind our aim, we chose those
that are the “best sites” in the coastal belt of the Geopark and built a didactic path. Unfortunately, up to
now, the educational itinerary in the area is still a missing topic, and when consulting the Geopark
web page it is possible to find only general information about the geology of the Geopark, the wildlife,
and the vegetation. The Geopark website, in fact, suggests only one poorly detailed itinerary in the
karst area of the Bussento river [84]. In such a context, the paper herein and one recently published [35]
address the potential educational value of geosites in the Cilento, Vallo di Diano, and Alburni Geopark,
and they may be used as examples of how to use geosites to divulge geological knowledge to a wide
audience. By adopting a similar geological approach, didactic routes may be organized within the
Geopark, choosing the best sites for various environmental topics.
International tourism is a fundamental economic resource for the coastal areas of the Cilento,
Vallo di Diano, and Alburni Geopark [65,66]. In fact, the economy of the coastal areas is mainly based
on international tourism, although it is mainly focused during summertime, and the preferred touristic
destinations are the beaches and the archeological sites of Elea-Velia and Paestum [66,67]. Considering
that any development of the Cilento, Vallo di Diano, and Alburni Geopark should be based on the
enhancement of local resources through the active cooperation of all local actors [67], our work may be
an incitement for the Geopark administrators to develop educational activity as a source for touristic
interest. The development of such an activity might also contribute to extending the tourist presence
beyond summertime, over most of the year.
To analyze the potential of the geoitinerary and to highlight possible activities addressed to its
efficiency and effective use, we also defined the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
through the SWOT analysis, whose results are reported in Table 3.
We strongly believe that increasing the base geological knowledge of each citizen, from the student
to the politician or the administrator, may contribute to increasing the awareness in respect to the
evolution of our planet and its environmental systems. Indeed, to achieve integrated management
of resources and spaces in a coastal area, it is critical to understand the possible change patterns,
which differ substantially in the two environmental scenarios we have focused on, i.e., the sea cliffs
and coastal plains. For instance, given the widespread and in some instances dense use of coastal
land, it is crucial for people to become acquainted with the risk under which properties, people,
and their economic activities are eventually posed by coastal recession and instabilities in both the
short and long terms. The scenarios that we selected as sites for visits represent meaningful examples
of the instability of both rocky coasts under the current, meteorologically-driven coastal dynamics,
and low-lying coastal areas exposed to the impact of future sea level rise. Now more than ever before,
it is mandatory to generate public awareness about geology and environmental conditions related
to global climate change. Issues such as coastal erosion and submergence of coastlines are becoming
popular and, in this respect, evidence of the striking environmental impact of the relatively-subdued
sea level rise that occurred in the Elea-Velia area appears as a meaningful exemplification of possible
future change in comparable scenarios.
Geotourism may be one of the most useful tools to spread knowledge on the dynamicity of
the natural environment. However, to reach this goal, individual and/or group visitors should get
knowledge in advance through guide boards and educational or informational image data. With our
work, we tried to achieve such an objective and our wish is that the explanatory material we designed
may constructively support geopark guides and teachers aiming at promoting the Geopark area and
spreading geological knowledge, respectively, through geotourism.

The geoitinerary could promote similar
initiatives in other sectors of the Geopark.
The geoitinerary could bring tourists in this
area all over the year and not only during the
summer period.
The geoitinerary could be used by schools of
every level for educational purposes in the field
of environmental science.
The Elea-Velia site give the opportunity to see
an archaeological site not only from an
historical perspective.
The geoitinerary could be split in two days thus
providing enough time for the tourists to enjoy
the hospitality of local people, the beaches, the
sea and the local food.

The geoitinerary is a personal initiative by the
Authors and lacks, up to now, enough of an
intense collaboration with both the Geopark
and local administration.
The full development of the geoitinerary needs
funding and a management policy.
Local people and local administration have not
yet fully understood the high touristic and
didactic potential of the area.
Tourists reach the study area because of the
amazing seas and beaches but they have no
cognition of the environmental estate in
the surroundings.
The tour from San Marco to Licosa cape is flat
but needs ~1 h of walking.

The San Marco sea-cliff is controlled and
managed because it could be affected
by rock-fall.
Some fences in the San Marco sea-cliff area
needs maintenance
Lack of financial resource to develop
the geoitinerary
Low interest in local authorities for the
development of Geotourism

Finally, we intended for the interdisciplinary perspective we propose for the Elea-Velia
archaeological site to serve as a contribution to increasing its touristic interest. We selected Elea-Velia
to suggest that, for an archaeological site, the availability of geological information which integrates
information on historical or cultural issues through the explanation of the environmental conditions
that existed during the human frequentation may provide the tourist with a more comprehensive view
of the interaction between human activities (agriculture, commerce, etc.) and the natural landscape.
This may be a new approach for the valorization of archaeological sites. Archaeological heritage
is one of the most important economic resources of Italy and, particularly, of the Campania region,
where numerous archaeological sites ranging in value from global to national and regional interest are
located. Most of those sites, besides telling of history, architecture, and figurative art, bear the legacy of
geological and/or geomorphological processes and human—environment interaction. Despite this,
there is still no effort, even in the most important sites such as Pompeii and Herculaneum excavations,
to divulge the natural aspect of the archaeological sites [85,86]. As we believe that learning from the
past is crucial to understand the present and future environmental crisis, we have put the attention on
the “other stories” that an archaeological site may narrate to its visitors.
