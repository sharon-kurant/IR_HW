Abstract
This paper examines the length of stay of cultural tourists in a mountain destination,
on the North-East of Italy. A microeconomic perspective of cultural tourism is
provided, where the interest is to analyse the attitude of visitors regarding culture
and their overall vacation. To this aim, visitors’ behavior to the South Tyrol's
Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano (Italy) is analysed through survey data. Unlike
similar studies, empirically, a zero-truncated negative binomial model is estimated as
a generalization of a Poisson distribution. The analysis shows which are the main
determinants that influence length of stay of cultural tourists. Nationality, age,
employment, income, costs associated with the travel have an impact on length of
stay. Specifically, variations in such factors correspond to variation in the span of the
vacation that is also positively affected by the presence of the icemen Ötzi in the
museum as well as by the presence of other cultural attractions. These findings
provide an essential tool to manage heritage resources and plan the future tourism
development around the Ötzi museum.
Keywords: Length of stay; cultural tourism; museum; zero-truncated negative
binomial; management implications.

1. Introduction
From a semantic viewpoint, cultural tourists are those who travel to
and spend at least 24 hours, and less than a year, in a given destination,
different from their usual residence, with the primary motivation to
gather new information and experiences to satisfy cultural needs (see also
Richards, 1996; 2003). According to the OECD (2009), cultural tourism
is one of the fastest-growing tourism markets. Nowadays, many
governments are investing in tangible and intangible cultural assets as a
means to attain comparative advantages, enhancing and supporting the
most recent glocalisation phenomenon. Glocalisation is a neologism that
describes a situation when competition has become global, but
competiveness still occurs at a local level.
In this respect, Italy provides an outstanding case study, as the
country hosts an immense heritage with its city of arts, historical urban
city centers, archeology and history. Sergardi and Biraghi (2007) estimate
cultural tourism in Italy grew by 25% between 2004-2006; this growth
was particularly driven by Western European (51%) and Extra-European
(22%) demand. Though the cultural tourism length of stay is relatively
smaller than traditional tourism (i.e. 7.1 nights for the former and 8.9
nights for the latter), the daily expenditure per capita in euro is the
highest (i.e. cultural tourism, 105.7; business, 95,7; traditional tourism,
73.6; others, 62.2). Hence, their study confirms that cultural tourists
generally have a higher spending propensity than other consumers’
segments (Europa Inform, 2004).
This paper explores the factors that influence cultural tourism. To
this aim, as an economic indicator, length of stay of cultural visitors is
employed. In the literature, length of stay is in fact considered of a great
importance since it has a positive correlation with profits derived from
tourism (Barros et. al., 2010). Within a microeconomic setting, the
objective of this paper is to provide evidence on the attitude of a
museum visitors regarding culture and their overall vacation motivation.
As a case study, visitors’ experience to the South Tyrol's Museum of
Archaeology in Bolzano (Italy) is analysed. This museum, best known as
"Ötzi", hosts an Icemen that occupies a central position in the exhibition
area and is without doubt one of the main attractions. In 1991, an intact
glacier mummy of more than 5,000 years ago was discovered in the Alps
(Schnal Valley glacier), together with his accompanying artefacts
(clothing and equipment). This was an extraordinary finding that
provided a unique example of a man of the Chalcolithic Period who was
travelling at high altitudes. Hence, this museum is characterized by

2

authenticity and uniqueness, fundamental characteristics for such type of
cultural tourism.
Empirically, a zero-truncated negative binomial model is estimated
to understand in which manner each variable affects the length of stay,
taking into account tourists’ heterogeneity. The findings provide useful
information for the Ötzi museum managers and policy makers of its
hosting city, giving further insight on how better exploit this ancient
discovery for the future planning and tourism development of the city.
Furthermore, the results may be used to help promoting further the
length of stay of cultural tourists in Bolzano as well as in the whole
South Tyrol region, provided a deeper understanding on the overall
socio-economic impact of such a niche tourism activity within the local
economy.
The paper is organized as follows. In the following section, an
updated literature review is provided. In Section 3, the methodological
framework is highlighted. Section 4 provides a description of the case
study. In Section 5, a description of the questionnaire is provided.
Section 6 gives an account of the empirical findings. Concluding
remarks are presented in the last section.
2. Literature review
2.1 Cultural tourism and economic impact
In the last few decades, cultural tourism has been defined in a
number of ways (Silbeberg, 1995; Richards, 2003), however all
definitions converge on the single concept, that is moving people for
cultural purposes. Tourism and culture are intrinsically connected by
their capacity to attract people and their role in destination
competitiveness. Together these two activities produce synergies able to
promote growth. As OECD (2009) points out, “cultural tourism is one
of the largest and fastest growing global tourism markets and the cultural
and creative industries are increasingly being used to promote
destinations”.
Richards (2003), further investigating on the concept of cultural
tourism, makes a parallel between culture and tourism and growth in
demand and supply. As a matter of fact, cultural tourism is characterized
by similar push and pull factors comparable to those of tourism activity
able to stimulate the economy (see Brida and Pulina, 2010). The
objective of a cultural tourist is to exploit cultural attractions such as
historical cities, archaeological sites, monuments and museums.

3

According to the Irish Tourist Board (1988) and Richards (1996) these
kind of travellers are definable as “specific cultural tourists” if, the visit
in a destination has a specific cultural motivation while are “general
cultural tourist” if, during their vacation, they also visit a cultural
attraction though their travel has not being motivated by culture.
The literature shows that museums play a key role in attracting
tourists in urban areas contributing to the revitalisation of the city.
Examples of this kind can be found in Bilbao (Plaza, 2000), Manchester
(UK) (Evans and Shaw, 2004), Amsterdam and Berlin (Aalst and
Boogaarts, 2004).
A great quota of museum visitors may be defined as specific cultural
tourists. Specifically, cultural tourists are fascinated by the authenticity
and the uniqueness of cultural attractions. Amongst other cultural
attractions, museums have been indeed defined as an efficient marketing
tool for urban tourism (Jensen-Verbeke and Van Rekom, 1996) and as a
flagship of urban development (Hamnett and Shoval, 2003). Museums
have a role of as repository of cultural heritage and not replicable public
good able to produce revenues and other positive spill-over effects (e.g.
employment).
In addition, as Tufts and Milne (1999) highlight, museums exert a
pull attraction to the city from people with different background. It is in
the destination that consumption activities are combined with personal
experiences in such a way that cultural attractions, shopping centres and
other activities offer each other tourism services and experiences. Jolliffe
and Smith (2001) underline that an essential feature of tourists’
experiences derive from their contact with the local culture and heritage,
often as a result of the local museum visitation. The same authors
highlight how much museums can benefit from tourism though it is also
true that museums boost tourism. In fact, museums are regarded as a
part of the tourism system as well as a part of a holiday package.
During the last decade, the studies on the relationship between
museum and economic impacts have been increasing due to their
importance in the host community wealth. Dunlop (2004), via an inputoutput analysis, provides evidence on the effects of museums and
galleries on the Scottish economy. By employing an autoregressive
moving average (ARIMA) econometric analysis, Plaza (2006) analyses
the impact of the Guggenheim Museum of Bilbao (GMB) on tourism
demand. Carrying out a Delphi analysis in Australia Scott (2006) captures
perceptions of impact and value from professionals working with
museums as well as the general public. Plaza (2008) analyses the

4

economic impact of the GMB in the Basque economy. Çela et al. (2009),
with a qualitative approach, analyse visitor spending and the economic
impact of heritage sites at the Silos and Smokestacks National Heritage
Area, in Iowa. Choi et al. (2010) employ a choice modelling analysis to
evaluate the economic value of the Old Parliament House in Australia,
currently operating a museum of social and political history.
The present research aims to contribute to the existing literature in
this field considering cultural tourism in the city of Bolzano. The South
Tyrol's Museum of Archaeology, hosting the well-known man of the
Copper age, and its visitors are especially taken into account to study the
determinants of the length of stay in South Tyrol. This variable is in fact
of great importance since its positive correlation with profits derived
from tourism (Barros et. al., 2010).
2.2 An overview of length of stay literature
In the empirical literature, little attention is paid on modelling
tourism length of stay both from a macroeconomic and a
microeconomic perspective. Notably, tourist arrivals are the most
employed variable, whereas length of stay has rarely been adopted as the
dependent variable. Nevertheless, length of stay can be regarded as a
better economic indicator for the hospitality sector and public local
agents. Arguably, longer holidays are more likely to produce higher
expenditure in tourism goods and services, though the relationship may
not be linear. This translates into higher revenues for businesses and
multiplier effects within the local economy. Moreover, length of stay
provides useful information on the capability of a specific destination to
attract and maintain tourists’ flows, and it is a useful indicator to
businesses, investors and local institutions for future planning purposes
(e.g. Pulina, 2010).
To the authors’ knowledge, within a microeconomic framework,
none of the reviewed studies on museums and economic impact takes
into consideration length of stay of cultural tourists in a destination.
However, the importance of this variable in tourism has been recently
established by a strand of the literature that mainly refers to sun and sand
destinations (e.g. Alegre and Pou, 2006; Gokovali et al., 2007; MartinezGarcia and Raya, 2008; Menezes et al., 2008; Menezes et al. 2010;Barros
et al., 2010; Barros and Machado, 2010; Alegre et al. 2011). As
emphasised by Alegre and Pou (2006), length of stay allows to assess the
effect of tourism on residents’ wealth, that varies according to the time

5

spent by tourists at destination. Besides, according to the vacation
duration, different activities can be experienced by tourists.
Within this strand of research, micro-econometric models are mostly
employed to estimate determinants of length of stay, in contrast with
previous studies in the field that were mainly descriptive. For example,
using data referred to the high season from 1993 to 2003, Alegre and
Pou (2006) estimate a binomial logit model. The authors take into
consideration microeconomics factors to analyse length of stay in the
Balearic Islands. Some of the considered variables have a direct influence
in the length of stay (i.e. size of the family) but others are found as
indirect determinants (i.e. age, education, occupation). As a further
example, the study of Gokovali et al. (2007) was the first to apply a
survival model, since to analyse length of stay the Weibull specification
was preferred among other models. They examine a sun and sea
destination in Turkey, as the case study, and investigate how trip
characteristics and socio-demographics variables affect tourists’ length of
stay. Following the work by Govokoli et al. (2007), Menezes et al. (2008)
consider the length of stay of tourist in Azores (Portugal) and analyse
survey data by means of a Cox proportional hazard model (survival
model). It emerges that socio-demographics and trip characteristics are
able to explain length of stay.
Martinez-Garcia and Raya (2008) consider length of stay of low cost
tourism in Costa Brava (Catalonia, Spain) using a log-logistics and Cox
survival models. Employing survey data, they analyse the effect of
microeconomic determinants such as nationality, age, education,
occupation and travel characteristics on the length of stay. Barros et al.
(2008) analyse length of stay of Portuguese tourists in South America. By
running different survival models, they find that length of stay depends
positively on factors such as budget, nature and culture, negatively on
age, ethnicity and importance of security. The authors highlight as length
of stay is specific to each tourist destination.
More recently, Barros et al. (2010) examine length of stay of golf
tourists in Algarve (Portugal) highlighting that tourists’ socio-economic
characteristics such as age, education, nationality and motivation of the
trip contribute to increase length of stay. Besides, to investigate length of
stay determinants of tourists in Madeira Island (Portugal), Barros and
Machado (2010) use a sample selection survival model. Once more it
emerges that this variable is strongly dependent on socio-demographic
characteristics of tourists and in lesser degree on perceived
characteristics of the destination.

6

Despite this growing interest in survival models, a critique has been
recently moved by Thrare (2011) who assert that this class of models
complicate the length of stay analysis. The author empirically shows that
OLS regression describes length of stay and independent variable as
empirically well as survival models.
However, a further strand of research in tourism demand is given by
count models. As an example, Smith (1988) estimates per trip consumer
surplus of household in Pennysylvania using a Poisson Model that treats
visits as a count of "successful" outcomes. Hellerstein (1991) considers
two count model (Poisson and Negative Binomial) to estimate a country
level travel cost model in Minnesota controlling for censoring and
integer nature of trip demand. Equally, Helleström (2006) estimates a
bivariate mixed Poisson model for Swedish household tourism demand,
while Menezes et al. (2010) evaluate the determinants of length of stay of
tourists in the Azores (Portugal) estimating a zero truncated Poisson and
a zero truncated Negative Binomial Model. A recent application by
Alegre et al. (2011) analyses the length of stay of tourists in Balearics
Island (Spain), by estimating a conditional demand function with a latent
class truncated Poisson. The authors ascertain the existence of two
tourism segments with different preferences where, socio-economics
characteristic play a fundamental role. An overall interest in this class of
models has been shown by the most recent literature since their capacity
to take into consideration the intrinsic features of the analysed data.
The present study further contributes to the current debate on
length of stay with an application of a zero-truncated Negative Binomial
to ascertain, within a microeconomic framework, its determinants of
length of stay. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, tourists’
heterogeneity is explored in an area with different characteristics from
the well-researched sea and sun destinations.
3. The model
3.1 The theoretical framework
The present empirical research is underpinned to the consumer
behaviour theory developed by Lancaster (1966) and Rosen (1974).
Goods characteristics are the source of consumer’s utility whose final
aim is its maximization in terms of prices and quantities of
characteristics. Considering a tourist destination, several elements
contribute to determine consumer’s choice. Indeed, every destination
incorporates a bundle of characteristics and perceived features that will
determine the utility of each consumer.

7

A fundamental role in this sense is played by length of stay in the
destination that is determined by the tourists according to their budget,
time constraints and preferences. The tourist chooses to consume goods
x according to their characteristics, subject to an income constraint M,
and considering the prices of the purchased good (p(x1, x2, ….,xc)) nd the
other goods (d), as follows:

Max U(x1, x2, ….,xc)

subject to

p(x1, x2, ….,xc)+d=M

(1)

When booking a vacation the consumer-tourist chooses the typology of
holiday and the length of stay he/she prefers and can afford. Following
the framework built by Alegre et al. (2011), the demand function of
length of stay can be presented in the following form:
Lj=(xjc, pjc, Y, t, ηi, εj)

(2)

Therefore, the consumer-tourists will stay in a given destination j
according to destinations characteristics xjc, prices pjc, income Y, time
allocated to vacation t, individual non observable characteristics ηi and
destination non observable characteristics εj.. Following Alegre et al.
(2011), tourist-consumers do not share the same set of factors in their
utility function and for this reason it is important to account for
heterogeneity in a way to account for those who may prefer shorter
stays.
3.2 The empirical framework
In the present empirical model, for each individual the exact number of
nights spent on holiday is assessed, avoiding in this way the right
censoring problem (observation period ends before the event has taken
place). This is possible since all tourists are asked about their length of
stay. The variable cannot assume negative values and ranges from one to
N, and therefore is zero-truncated. Hence, the distribution includes
either a Poisson or a Negative Binomial.
As a first step, the methodological procedure used in this study consists
of running an initial standard Poisson, as a restriction of the more
general Negative Binomial distribution, where the distribution is given
by:
(3)

8

The parameter l>0 is average and variance of the Poisson distribution; wi
denotes the other controls (e.g. socio-economic characteristics of
individual i, perception of the bundle of characteristics of the destination
and costs). As the Poisson model is non-linear the maximum likelihood
technique is used.
In the literature, there appear many extensions of the Poisson model
according to the characteristics of the empirical data as well as because
of the stringent condition of the mean equal to the variance as previously
stated (Greene, 2003). In this specific case, a zero-truncated Negative
Binomial is empirically preferred to the zero-truncated Poisson. The
Negative Binomial allows for over-dispersion that occurs when only a
few individuals had a large number of visits, implying the variance in
visits is larger than the mean.
Specifically, in this case, length of stay is at least one night, that is a
record would not appear in the database if a visitor had not spent at least
a night out his/her usual place of residence. This model is specified by
the following equation:

(4)
where ϑ is an ancillary parameter to be estimated from the data, Γ is the
gamma function and Fp is the density function of the Poisson
distribution.
The estimation is run using maximum likelihood
(Menezes et al., 2010).
4. South Tyrol as a cultural destination
South Tyrol is one of the two autonomous provinces within the
autonomous region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol, located in the
north-east of Italy. The province, also known with its Italian name, Alto
Adige, has just above 500.000 inhabitants.
Bolzano, its provincial capital, counts for approximately 104,000
inhabitants. The economy is based on tourism, high-quality intensive
agriculture (including wine, fruit and dairy products), traditional
handicraft (wood, ceramics) and advanced services. South Tyrol
combines different cultures that blend Italian and North-European
architectonic features. Churches, palaces, museums are of most artistic
value. In the last two decades, the city of Bolzano has experienced a new

9

impulse to the cultural life that brought the openings of numerous
museums as well as multiple summer and winter events, such as the
“Christmas Markets”. Hence, the town has also a diversified tourism
supply, eno-gastronomic holiday in the valleys, mountain holiday and
cultural holiday, and the well-known cultural events, such as Südtirol Jazz
Festival and Bolzano Festival. Bolzano has also many art galleries as
“Galleria Goethe”, “Galleria Civica”, “Galleria Les Chances de l'Art”
and from 1905 is hosting the first museum of the entire region, the Civic
Museum of Bolzano. A number of other museums have been opened in
the last two decades indicating the growing attention towards art and
culture: in 1985, the “Museion”, a modern and contemporary art
museum; in 1995, the “Schulmuseum”, a museum of the school, the first
one of this genre in Italy, based on the Mittel-Europe experience; in
1997, the Natural Science museum of Alto Adige; in 1998, the South
Tyrol Museum of Archaeology. It is also has a “nativity scene” (presepio)
Museum, a Mercantile Museum and the “Dommuseum”(2007). In
addition, in 2006, the Firmian Castle of Bolzano was devolved as a
museum centre for the Messner Mountain Museum project. A total of
eighty museums are currently present in South Tyrol.
The principal attraction of the area is the Archaeological museum
situated in Bolzano and opened on March 1998 to host one of the
world’s best-known and most important mummies, Ötzi the Iceman, a
well-preserved natural mummy of a man dated from 53 centuries ago.
The museum is approximately 1200mq and the entire first floor is
dedicated to the Iceman findings. It has a permanent exhibition on
South Tyrol’s pre-historical and history, and also hosts temporary
exhibitions. Since its opening, it had around 250,000 visitors per year.
From a financial point of view, the museum has revenues from tickets
sales, merchandising, sponsors and publishing.
The territory of Bolzano offers mountain holidays but also cultural
holidays all the year round. It is worthwhile to analyse its tourism
demand and supply evolution. In 2010, the whole province counted over
10.000 accommodations among hotels and non-hotel infrastructure, such
as bed and breakfast, hostels and agro tourist activities. While the latter
sector grew by 8% between 2000 and 2010, the hotel sector decreased by
6% (Table 1). In terms of capacity (i.e. number of beds), non-hotel
infrastructures show a higher increase of 4%. The positive growth of the
latter sector in the province is confirmed by the outstanding growth in
the number of arrivals (+36%) and overnight stays (+20%). The Italian
component, expressed in terms of the number of arrivals, increased by

10

48% and overnight stays by 25%. Foreigners’ flows present a similar
picture: arrivals increased by 33% and overnights increased by 19%. It is
interesting to notice as overall, in the last decade, during the springsummer period, arrivals increased by 39% and overnight stays by 21%.
This good performance may be also due to the increase in the cultural
supply in the recent years, as previously described. Data on average
overnight of stays seem to reinforce this hypothesis: in 2000, people
stayed in South Tyrol on average 5.7 nights, while in 2010 stayed 5.0.
(Source: Statistics office of the autonomous province of Bolzano,
ASTAT), possibly showing a pattern for a different holiday type. These
findings provide some evidence that especially the Italians are changing
their habits preferring more frequent holidays for shorter period of time.
Comparing arrival flows in South Tyrol and visitor flows to the museum
may provide a better insight on the relationship between tourism and the
Ötzi museum. Data collected from the Statistic Office of the Province of
Bolzano (ASTAT) and museum visitors data, provided by the museum
administration, for the time span 2007-2010, allow for a comparison of
these time series (Figure 1) and their correlation.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient is equal to +0.999 denoting the positive
linear relationship between the two series. From Figure 1, it emerges that
the two flows have similar trend and hence are intrinsically connected.
Notably, Pearson’s correlation coefficient is equal to 0.790 when using
museum visitors time series and number of arrivals in the city of
Bolzano. This outcome seems to suggest that cultural tourists may spend
their holidays in the province rather than in the city.
This descriptive investigation offers a clearer picture on the potential
attractiveness of Bolzano and its province that may also denote the
positive impact of the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology on its
overall tourism activity.
5. The questionnaire and the sample
The survey was administered at the Ötzi museum in Bolzano, from June
to August 2010, via face-to-face interviews on weekdays (except for the
closing day on Mondays) and on Saturdays and Sundays, at different
opening hours (between 10.00 am – 6 pm). In a recent survey
investigation, conducted by Sergardi and Biraghi (2007) for Italian
cultural tourism, it emerges that, though cultural tourism seasonal
distribution is very stable during the year (from a minimum of 25% to a
maximum of 31%), nevertheless, traditional tourism in Italian provinces
sees the highest shares within June-August (ranging from 36% to 41%).

11

Hence, running the survey within the time span June- August can
provide better insight on the characteristics of tourists and the factors
that influence urban cultural tourism.
The respondents were selected with a quota random sampling procedure
based on age and gender trying to capture heterogeneous demographics
features. As opposed to random sampling, quota sampling requires that
representative respondents are chosen out a subset of individuals within
a population. Notwithstanding this procedure may lead to bias because
not everyone gets a chance to be selected, nevertheless, it overcomes the
potential bias derived from a random sample procedure, as the trial may
be likely to over-represent specific demographic characteristics, such as
gender or age. Based on the visitor’s data of the previous year provided
by the administrative office of the museum, the sample size was
determined according to a 95% confidence level with a 5% error. It was
fixed in 350 visitors per month. Finally, 724 complete interviews were
successfully concluded.
Among all respondents, 582 of them (80%) declared to have spent at
least one night in South Tyrol, outside the habitual place of residence.
Hence, according with the definition of tourist, this portion of
respondents is considered as cultural tourists.
The questionnaire contained in total 36 questions, organized in four
blocks: the first section asked trip information, the next demanded
information about the city of Bolzano, then information on the visit to
the museum are collected and, as the last section, a sequence of
questions on socio-economics characteristics of the visitors. In the
questions on how important is to visit Bolzano and the museum,
information, motivation, satisfaction and loyalty a Likert scale was used
ranging from ‘not important’ to ‘very important’ for the motivation
factors, from ‘strongly in disagreement’ to ‘strongly in agreement’ for
assessing tourist’s satisfaction, and from ‘very unlikely’ to ‘very likely’ for
the loyalty factors.
Main characteristics of the sample are here analysed in order to give a
better picture tourists visiting the Archaeological Museum and Bolzano.
Most of the visitors (64%) came from other European countries rather
than Italy (25%) (Table 2). Interestingly, comparing these survey data
with those proposed by the official statistics, the average length of stay
of the sample (7.8 days) is greater of the traditional tourism average
length of stay in South Tyrol (5.0 days) and consistent with Sergardi and
Biraghi (2007) who computed an average length of stay of 7.1 days for
cultural tourists. This outcome is different from a typical sea and sun

12

destination that denotes a traditional tourism length of stay higher than a
cultural tourism length of stay (Sergardi and Biraghi computed 8.9 days
of traditional tourists).
From Table 2, it emerges that responders are mostly male (56%),
generally married or de-facto (80%), with a family of 3-4 members
(51%); those between 41 and 55 years old are more interested in the
museum visitation (47%) if compared to other age range. Regarding the
education level, 50% had a college degree or a higher degree. As far as
income is concerned, 39% of the sample had a middle-high average
income, while just 3% less than 20.000 euros per year. It is important to
notice that for 58% of the sample is their first time in Bolzano and for
89% is their first visit to the Archeological Museum. The great part
(78%) would equally visit the city even if it were not hosting the Iceman
Ötzi, that however has the high potentiality to attract tourists considered
that 89% is willing to visit another city that would host it. Also, 11%
expressed a strong intention to revisit the museum the following year,
while 24% had a strong intention to come back to Bolzano and 40%
would strongly recommend the city to relatives and friends. Besides,
56% declared that they will very likely advise relatives and friends to visit
this museum.
Considering the family unit that spends at least one night out, the
average expenditure for accommodation is approximately 96 euros per
night, while 61 euros for food and beverage. On balance, tourists have a
higher spending propensity in the museum shop, as well as in doing
shopping in the city, than daily visitors.
6. Empirical results and discussion
The econometric estimation is based upon the theoretical framework
previously specified. The relevant variables included into the model, and
obtained by the survey data, are described in greater details in the
Appendix A, Table 1.A.
The best specification has been identified as a zero-truncated Negative
Binomial. The estimation is run by using STATA 10 and results are
reported on coefficients and IRR (incidence rate ratio) obtained taking
the exponent of the zero-truncated Negative Binomial regression
coefficient (Table 4).
The dependent variable, length of stay in South Tyrol, allows for the specific
restriction, ranging from one to N (i.e. the count variable cannot be
zero), given the definition of cultural tourism provided previously. The
goodness-of-fit test in the standard Poisson model (estatgof in Stata 10)

13

suggests that the null hypothesis (i.e. the empirical model fits the data)
cannot be accepted (i.e. Goodness-of-fit chi2 = 492.79 - Prob >
chi2(178) = 0.0000). Hence, a negative binomial needs to be estimated.
Furthermore, comparing the standard negative binomial with the zerotruncated negative binomial the AIC (1140.94; 1131.36, respectively) and
BIC (1276.87; 1267.29, respectively) information criteria are minimised in
the latter model. Besides, the Wald test indicates that the overall model
is well specified at the level of significance of 1%. Hence, there is
statistical ground to retain the zero-truncated negative binomial as a
better empirical specification. The model has been estimated correcting
for robust standard errors, given the relatively low number of
observations may lead to heteroskedasticity problems in the residuals.
Taking into account statistically significant coefficients (at least at the
10% level of significance), among the socio-demographic and economic
characteristics, ceteris paribus, it emerges that nationality is relevant as an
explanatory factor in the case of Italians who denote a relatively low
probability to increase the length of stay. This fact may be due to either
an overall lower spending capacity or propensity. With regard to age and
employment status, the findings show a smaller probability to stay for
the group under the age of 30. This outcome may due to the fact that
this category of people, on the one hand, has in general less spare time
and, on the other hand, a lower income level, that does not facilitate of
longer period of vacation. On the opposite, people aged 60 years or
more denote a higher probability to stay longer. As far as the income
range is concerned, the group who has an income up to twenty thousand
euro presents a higher probability to increase the length of stay in South
Tyrol.
One can discriminate between general and specific cultural tourists, by
taking into account the importance that respondents attribute of visiting:
Bolzano as a city, Bolzano because it hosts the Ötzi museum, other
museums in the city, and if the respondent would have visited any other
city that had hosted the Ötzi museum, if it were not have been located in
Bolzano. The findings reveal that respondents can be indeed regarded as
specific cultural tourists, as they are likely to increase their vacation time
when they attribute a higher importance in visiting Bolzano because it
hosts the Ötzi museum. Moreover, their vacation duration in South
Tyrol, would be shorter, if the museum of Ötzi had not been located in
Bolzano. Though the latter coefficient turns out not to be statistically
significant, the negative sign in the Know-BZ and the positive sign in
visit_otmus variable further confirm that the respondents are more likely

14

to be specific cultural tourists. These results are even more meaningful as
the survey was conducted during the time span June and August,
revealing that specific cultural tourists, in South Tyrol, do not dislike
visiting the destination during the tourism high season of the province.
Turning to the pull and push factors, bad weather, as a pull factor,
encourages visits to the archaeological museum and longer vacation
duration in South Tyrol. Besides, travel costs and living costs, as
supposed theoretically, negatively influence length of stay in the
province.
7. Concluding remarks
In this paper, a microeconomic analysis has been carried out to explore
the definition of cultural tourist and what are the main determinants of
their length of stay in a destination. The case study is the South Tyrol's
Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano (Italy), best known as the Ötzi
museum.
The empirical investigation has been underpinned to the consumer
behaviour theory developed by Lancaster (1966) and Rosen (1974).
Goods characteristics are assumed to be the source of consumer’s utility
whose final aim is maximize his/her utility in terms of prices and
quantities of characteristics of a destination.
Empirical data were obtained via a survey on 724 visitors at the museum
from June to August 2010. Overall, evidence has been provided that
cultural length of stay in a mountain destination with two peak seasons
(summer and winter) seems higher than length of stay in more traditional
tourism destinations. Given the specific characteristics of the dependent
variable (i.e. length of stay), that is a count variable that assumes at least
the value of one, a zero-truncated Negative Binomial has been estimated,
as it has outperformed the zero-truncated Poisson model as the nested
case. As the main objective of this research, there is empirical evidence
that respondents, who visit the Ötzi museum, are mainly interested in a
cultural experience and can be regarded as specific tourists.
Ötzi, and consequentially the Archaeological Museum, is already
considered as the main attraction of the city of Bolzano, however,
according to the present research it deserves even more attention from
local institutions. Local press (Mair, 2010; Vikoler, 2010) reported the
inadequacy of the existing building hosting Ötzi and the debate around
the possibility to transfer it in a larger building. So far, a decision has not
been taken. However, policy makers should closely consider the impact

15

that Ötzi has on tourism and their motivation to extend their vacation to
visit this unique museum. The empirical analysis has shown the need for
a long-term development strategy around this museum, that enables to
attract new tourism flows.
The contribution of the present study, in applying a novel empirical
approach into the investigation of length of stay of cultural tourists in a
mountain destination, can be further tested for and expanded to other
heritage sites of this kind, providing robustness to the present paper.
Besides, a future challenge of research in this field will involve a
systematic investigation on the complementary and substitute effects
amongst other important museums in the whole region of Trentino Alto
Adige.
