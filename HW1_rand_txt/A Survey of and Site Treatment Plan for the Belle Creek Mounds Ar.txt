Abstract
The Prairie Island Indian Community (PIIC) recently purchased property, on which a
portion of a prominent archeological site, encompassing 67 formerly documented burial
mounds, resides. In order to better protect the burial mounds and other culturally significant
material on the site, as well as on sites residing on the remainder of their new property, the
PIIC enlisted the support of Minnesota State University, Mankato’s Earth Science,
Archeology, Resources, and Terrestrial Hazards (EARTH) Systems Research Laboratory
in developing a site treatment plan. Developing a useful site treatment plan necessitated
conducting a geoarcheological survey of a portion of the archeological site, known as the
Belle Creek Mounds site, on the acquired property. The survey included both geospatial
and geophysical survey to locate and identify burial mounds, impacts to burial mounds,
and evidence of site usage. Limited excavation took place to better understand the extent
to which buried cultural materials need protection, how ancient people used the
archeological site in the distant past, and how Belle Creek Mounds relates to other sites in
the surrounding area. Geophysical techniques produced results supporting their
effectiveness at identifying impacted and previously unmapped mounds on site. The
artifacts recovered during limited excavation at Belle Creek Mounds are similar to artifacts
recovered at previously investigated aggregation villages within the Red Wing Region.
This thesis is for use by PIIC, in combination with geospatial and geophysical datasets
generated by this and related projects, to assist in protecting the Belle Creek Mounds site
and surrounding sites and in setting a precedent supporting greater use of geophysical
techniques in archeological investigations of potential mortuary features.

Chapter 1 – Introduction
The Prairie Island Indian Community (PIIC), in southeastern Minnesota, is facilitating a
rekindling of its relationship with locations significant to its ancestry. The community has
recently purchased a property (Figure 1-1) encompassing six archeological sites, most of
which are associated with pre-Euro-American contact Native American earthworks
commonly referred to as mounds.

Figure 1-1: Geographic location of PIIC property and Belle Creek Mounds
Archeological Site.
Mounds are normally primarily constructed of soils surrounding and within 30 meters of
their boundary and tend to be roughly circular (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:65 and 136).

2
Those that are roughly circular average 12.29 meters in diameter and 1.09 meters in height
(Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:65). Mounds regularly contain ritually buried human
remains, containing human remains more than 75% of the time (Arzigian and Stevenson
2003:232). The most prominent of the archeological sites located on PIIC’s new property
is formally identified as 21GD0072 and known as the Belle Creek Mounds site, which
archeologists interpret as being associated with the Woodland Tradition, Middle
Mississippian Tradition influenced Silvernale Phase, as well as the Oneota Tradition
commonly encountered throughout southern and central Minnesota (Minnesota Office of
the State Archaeologist 2021b). To protect the Belle Creek Mounds site, as well as the
other associated archeological sites residing on their new property, the PIIC worked with
Minnesota State University, Mankato’s Earth Science, Archeology, Resources, and
Terrestrial Hazards (EARTH) Systems Research Laboratory, on a project to develop a site
treatment plan informed through a geoarcheological survey, supervised by Dr. Ronald
Schirmer.
A site treatment plan for the Belle Creek Mounds site, because of its cultural and
archeological importance, its similarity to the other archeological sites also present on
PIIC’s newly acquired property, and its greater visibility and accessibility, gave the
EARTH Systems Research Laboratory (ESRL) an opportunity to facilitate an
understanding of the nature, extent, and conditions of archeological and cultural material
on PIIC’s new property. This site treatment plan seeks to aid the PIIC in both protecting
and interpreting the archeological materials present on the Belle Creek Mounds site in
addition to the remainder of their newly acquired property. It also seeks to supplement

3
southeastern Minnesota’s archeological record and further establish the use of geophysical
and geospatial techniques in archeological site protection. This thesis is one part of what
will certainly need to be a more extensive site treatment plan; only the cultural resources
are considered here, but other types of resources and situations (e.g., plants, erosion, etc.)
will need to be considered in a broader treatment plan for the whole property.
The PIIC’s acquisition of the northern portion of the Belle Creek Mounds archeological
site is significant due to North American indigenous communities experiencing, especially
over the last 200 years, forced disconnection from the sense of place and meaning derived
through physical interaction with areas of cultural-historical importance. The United States
of America’s Indian Removal Act of 1830 formalized a long period of intensive
displacement, dispossession of Native American homelands, and in some cases, genocide
of Native American peoples (Colwell-Chanthaphonh 2005:377). However, immigrants to
North America began displacing Native American people long before the Indian Removal
Act, throughout the colonization of North America and creation and growth of the United
States (Littlefield and Parins 2011:xiii–xv).
Following the government of the United States coercing Native American tribes into
ceding their lands, indigenous people within the United States lost rights to access many
of the properties linked with their past. The enactment of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966 involved Native American tribes in a consultation process revolving
around the preservation of areas of historical significance potentially impacted by federally
associated projects within the United States (U.S.) (U.S. Congress 1966:35–36). However,
this act did not grant federally recognized tribes the right to unilaterally disallow the

4
destruction of sites that tribes deemed important to protect. The NHPA also failed to give
tribal members the right to access sites, associated with their past, preventing cultural
connection with them through presence or ceremony.
Years of Native American advocacy and protest spurred the U.S. government’s passage of
stronger legislation allowing tribes and federal agencies to protect areas of cultural
significance from destruction and looting, as well as granting Native Americans access to
culturally significant areas to perform religious ceremonies (Horton 2017:23). The Indian
Religious Freedom Act of 1978 allowed Native Americans to access places they regarded
as sacred, and the Archaeological Resource Protection Act of 1979 made it illegal for an
individual to excavate and remove artifacts from federal or tribal lands with the exception
of arrowheads and excavation and removal done with federal or tribal permission (U.S.
Congress 1978, 1979:139–145). These acts still allowed for the destruction of Native
American burial grounds on private land and possession of Native American remains and
cultural patrimony from burial sites located on public land. In the state of Minnesota,
Statute 307.08 was updated in 1980 to prevent the molestation of all human remains and
burials found on public and private land without permission from the State Archaeologist
and Indian affairs inter-tribunal board, now the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council
(Minnesota Legislature 1980). This included protections against looting and excavating
Pre-Contact Native American burial mounds. The Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act of 1990 gave tribes the ability to repossess Native American human
remains and cultural patrimony held in public institutions or recovered from public lands
(U.S. Congress 1990).

5
Unfortunately, despite the relatively recent passage of meaningful legislation encouraging
the protection of Native American burials and archeological sites in the U.S. and
Minnesota, many Native American burial sites, including mound sites, continue to be
damaged and neglected. People continue to be ignorant or disrespectful of indigenous
wishes as to how Native American burial grounds, including mound sites, should be
treated. One Minnesotan, in 2014, expressed a negligent perspective on Native American
mounds when he reported being bothered by not having the ability to build onto his house
or move his garage because of a mound on his property that he believed was looted and
was therefore meaningless to Native Americans (Smetanka 2014). Additional damage to
previously impacted burial mounds likely took place in Red Wing, Minnesota, in 2013,
when a new trail was constructed in an area that once contained mounds, without proper
review including the Office of the State Archaeologist (Minnesota Office of the State
Archaeologist 2014:25). Moreover, construction of a border wall by the United States
along its southern border, knowingly threatened indigenous burial grounds (Ortiz 2020).
If indigenous communities own the land on which sites with special religious and cultural
significance reside, the communities have more rights in terms of protection and use,
resulting in fewer threats to a significant area’s integrity as well as ease of access for
religious rites (Post 2006). In order to promote the best possible practices in preserving,
using, and appreciating archeological and cultural sites, it is necessary to understand the
types and extent of archeological and culturally significant materials present, what their
condition and history is, and possible threats to their preservation. For this reason, an
archeological survey is important to perform on newly acquired properties.

6
As is shown in Chapter 4, some of the cultural resources that were formerly visible at the
site no longer have determinable surface expression and must be sought using advanced
geophysical means. However, a larger mound in a highly impacted area on site, and
mounds in formerly uncultivated wooded areas remain visible and have discrete
geophysical signatures lending complementary data to the identification of mounds
damaged beyond the point of visual identification and previously unidentified visible
mounds. Recovered and noted cultural material present among and adjacent to the mound
group allows for more refined interpretation of the people who potentially used, built, and
lived among the Belle Creek mound group in the distant past, and gives tangible support
to substantial village or ceremonial archeological deposits being present in close proximity
to the mound group.
Appropriate cultural protocols congruent with the wishes and traditions of the Prairie Island
Indian Community were followed upon arriving at the site.

Chapter 2 – Background
Location
The Belle Creek Mounds archeological site is located within Goodhue County in
southeastern Minnesota partially on property recently purchased by the Prairie Island
Indian Community in Welch Township, approximately 2 kilometers west of the city limits
of Red Wing, Minnesota (Figure 1-1) (Minnesota Department of Transportation and
Minnesota Geospatial Information Office 2009). The Prairie Island Indian Community’s
property consists of 48.87 hectares of land, 5.58 of which make up the northwestern half
of the 10.03-hectare Belle Creek Mounds archeological site (Esri Inc. 2020; Goodhue
County 2020; Minnesota Department of Transportation 2017). The project’s primary area
of investigation within the Belle Creek Mounds site is a 100 x 40-meter rectangular area
with a 20 x 20-meter square area appended on to its western edge at its northwestern corner.
The area of investigation is 0.45 hectares in size, and just northeast of the approximate
center of the Belle Creek Mounds site, on PIIC property (Figure 2-1). The site occupies a
terrace positioned along the northern bank of the Cannon River at elevations of
approximately 245 to 250 meters above mean sea level (MAMSL), about 40 meters higher
than the elevation of the Cannon River adjacent to the site location (Minnesota IT Services
- Geospatial Information Office 2011). The site and property are fairly close to the Cannon
River’s confluence with the Mississippi River, which is approximately 10 kilometers east.

8

Figure 2-1: Primary area of investigation within the Belle Creek Mounds site boundary
and PIIC property boundary.
The site and property are both located within the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural
Resource Conservation Service’s (NRCS’s) Eastern Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies
Major Land Resource Area (United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources
Conservation Service 2006:324). This area is within the U.S. Interior Plains’ Central
Lowland Physiographic Provence described as being mostly associated with dissected till
plains, but in small part with the less-recently glaciated Wisconsin Driftless Section in its
northeastern portion (United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources
Conservation Service 2006:324). Surficial geological geospatial data indicates that the
Belle Creek Mounds archeological site resides upon glacio-fluvial outwash sands from the

9
Late Wisconsin Subdivision of the Late Pleistocene Epoch or Early Holocene Epoch,
~10,000 – 8,000 BCE, surrounded by uplands associated with Pre-Illinoian Till, with a
depositional age less than ~700,000 BP, but greater than ~300,000 BP. This geospatial data
indicates that the site was not glaciated during any of the Wisconsin Sub-divisions or
Illinoian Sub-division on the geological time scale (Fullerton et al. 2003; National Soil
Survey Center 2012:5–9; Ojakangas and Matsch 1982:104 and 233).
The Wisconsin Driftless Area was likely glaciated during far less recent Pre-Illinoian
glaciations, but hundreds of thousands more years of wind and water related erosion and
deposition created a landscape with greater relief and far fewer lakes than the more recently
glaciated surrounding areas (Ojakangas and Matsch 1982:233). The reason there are so few
lakes in the area is because of its well-drained soils and extensive dendritic drainage
pattern. Minnesota’s Geology describes the landscape near Red Wing, Minnesota as:
one of rolling hills and well-established stream networks… considerably
eroded and displaying numerous bedrock outcrops on the valley sides.
Mantling the drift and bedrock is a thin blanket of loess, a fine-textured silt,
powdery to the touch, deposited by the wind during the last glaciation
(Ojakangas and Matsch 1982:104).
Loess deposits can range from 9 meters in depth on broad ridges to less than 30 centimeters
in depth along valley walls (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources 2021).
The underlying bedrock geology near Red Wing, Minnesota consists of Paleozoic, 542 Ma
– 251 Ma, marine sandstones, carbonates, like dolomite and limestone, and shales
containing fossils. This material is occasionally topped with more recent Cretaceous age
material, 145 Ma – 65.5 Ma, reflecting both marine and continental environments just
below glacial deposits from the early and middle Pleistocene, 2.6 Ma – 300,000 BP, and

10
post-glacial sediments from the Holocene, 10,000 – 0 BP (National Soil Survey Center
2012:5–9; Ojakangas and Matsch 1982:234). The area’s river valleys are filled with recent
alluvium made up of clay, silt, sand, and gravel (United States Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation Service 2006:325).
Red Wing, Minnesota’s current climate is classified as a humid continental climate using
the Köppen climate classification system. The average annual temperature in Red Wing is
7.1°C or 44.8°F with seasonal fluctuations, including a low monthly average of –10.8°C
or 12.6°F in January and a high average of 22.3°C or 72.1°F in July; the average annual
precipitation is 774 mm. or 30.5 inches (Climate-Data.org 2021). According to the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources’ (MNDNR) and United States Forest
Service’s (USFS’s) ecological classification system, the posited pre-Euro-American
settlement vegetation within the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site’s ecological
subsection consists of tallgrass prairies on broad ridge tops, bur oak savannas on ridge tops
and dry high slopes, red oak, white oak, shagbark hickory, and basswood forests on moister
slopes, and red oak, basswood, and black walnut forests in protected valleys (Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources 2021). As the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site is
on a broad higher terrace with a south-facing slope within a river valley, a red oak,
basswood, and black walnut forest or a tallgrass prairie are two probable candidates for its
pre-Euro-American settlement vegetation. The present land usage distribution for the
Blufflands Subsection, which the study area resides within, is 30% cropland, 20% pasture,
and 50% woodland (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources 2021).

11
Making sense of an archeological site, especially while attempting to use geophysical
methods to do so, is made easier by understanding the soils in the areas being analyzed.
The soils within the area of investigation at the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site
consist of moderately eroded Lindstrom silt loam associated with 12 to 18 percent slopes,
moderately eroded Lindstrom silt loam associated with 6 to 12 percent slopes, and
moderately eroded Lilah sandy loam associated with 0 to 6 percent slopes (Soil Survey
Staff 2021). Both Lindstrom series soils are taxonomically classified as fine-silty, mixed,
superactive, mesic, Cumulic Hapludolls and tend to develop in loess or alluvial sediments
on foot slopes or toe slopes of dissected uplands (Soil Survey Staff 2005). The Lilah series
soil is taxonomically classified as a mixed, mesic, Psammentic Hapludalf and tends to form
in loamy sediments and in underlying gravelly outwash (Soil Survey Staff 2007). The
Lindstrom series soils comprise the northern 2/3 of this project’s area of investigation and
the Lilah series soil comprises the remaining southern 1/3 (Figure 2-2) (Soil Survey Staff
2016). The native vegetation associated with the soil types on site is consistent with the
MNDNR/USFS ecological classification system’s posited pre-settlement vegetation, noted
above. Lindstrom series soils are reported as having mixed tall grass prairie and deciduous
forest as native vegetation. Lilah series soils are reported as having mixed big bluestem,
switchgrass, and other tall grass prairie grasses and deciduous trees as native vegetation.
Although the Lindstrom and Lilah series soils have similar native vegetation, their typical
pedons have significant differences. The profile of the Lindstrom type soil can be broken
down as: Ap 0–23 cm., black (10YR 2/1) silt loam; A1 23–56 cm., very dark brown (10YR
2/2) silt loam; A2 56–74 cm., very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; Bw1 74–97

12
cm., dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; Bw2 97–112 cm., brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; Bw3
112–152 cm., dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; C 152–178 cm., yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4) loam (Soil Survey Staff 2005). The profile of the Lilah type soil can be
broken down as: Ap 0–15 cm., very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam; BA 15–
23 cm., dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) sandy loam; Bt1 23–38 cm., brown (7.5YR 4/4)
gravelly sandy loam; 2Bt2 38–71 cm., strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly loamy sand;
2Bt3 71–99 cm., strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sand; 2C 99–203 cm., strong brown (7.5YR
5/8) loamy sand (Soil Survey Staff 2007). The Lindstrom soil series has a much thicker A
horizon, weakly developed B horizons, as well as a consistently silty texture associated
with a smaller particle size. The Lilah soil series has a sandy texture associated with a
larger particle size, thinner A horizon, 3 well developed clay rich B horizons, two of which
are derived from different parent material than the horizons above them, and excessive
drainage.

13

Figure 2-2: SSURGO soil map including the area of investigation at the Belle Creek
Mounds Archeological Site.
The genesis of Lindstrom soil series within the area of investigation (AOI) can be explained
using the soil catena concept. The Lindstrom soil likely has a much thicker topsoil than the
Lilah series further south because in the area where the Lindstrom soil is located, colluvium
from the slope to the north accumulates as a result of the area within the northern part of
the AOI residing on a toeslope. The two different parent material types present in the Lilah
soil series profile are explained by eolian loess covering a terrace tread comprised of glacial
outwash following the outwash’s deposition.
The formation process of the area’s river channels and their associated terraces is of
concern to geomorphologists. Local terrace formation on the tributaries of the Upper

14
Mississippi River in the Wisconsin Driftless Area is inferred as beginning with the
aggradation or buildup of glacial outwash sediment in tributary channels during glacial
melting followed by stream incision and partial removal of the deposited outwash
facilitated by drops in water elevation at streams’ mouths (Faulkner et al. 2016:85 and 89–
92). Following incision, a relatively smaller accumulation, aggradation, of sediment on
either side of streams created somewhat-flat floodplains during minor flood events with
major riverbed armor breaching flood events and further drops in water elevation at
streams’ mouths beginning further incision leaving behind portions of unincised former
floodplain as terraces, higher than where new floodplains formed (Faulkner et al. 2016:85
and 89–92). For a more detailed description of these fluvial geomorphological processes
read Faulkner et al. 2016.
Archeological Theoretical Foundations and Setting
In attempting to discern the reasons for the presence of and relationships between various
artifacts and features associated with past people, archeologists developed artificial artifact
and feature based taxonomies that are ultimately combined to define manifestations of
specific artificially defined archeological cultural groupings (Hegmon 1992:530–531).
Here, “artifact” is defined as a human used, modified, or manufactured object, and
“feature” is defined as non-portable evidence of past human activity including refuse and
storage pits, architectural remains, fire hearths, artifact clusters, and anthropogenic soil
stains (Kelly and Hurst Thomas 2017:2 and 29). The stylistic characteristics of artifacts
and features are inextricably linked to adaptive human technological production, function,

15
and exchange, social organization, communication of ethnic affiliation, and/or expression
of a particular ideology (Hegmon 1992:519 and 531–532; Schortman 1989:56–59).
However, ethnographic observations indicate that the artifacts used in distinguishing a
person’s specific identity may not preserve well, preventing archeologists from ever fully
reconstructing a past society’s system of affiliations (Schortman 1989:56). Even so,
through analyses and determinations of associated types of preserved stylistic variations in
spatially and temporally distinct artifacts and features, cultural associations can be created
or assigned in connection with inferred past populations that manufactured the recovered
artifacts and features found at archeological sites (Schortman 1989:56–57). It then stands
to reason that through analyses of artifacts and features’ stylistic variations, evidence of
changes within and interactions between cultural groupings can be indicated with the
adoption of stylistic characteristics lacking presence earlier in a population’s timeline.
Analogical inference is central to the previously discussed analytical approach, with one
archeologist and philosopher supporting the validity of analogical inference citing existing
methodological strategies for evaluating the strength of inferences, for adding support for
or against specific inferences, and for rejecting false analogies (Wylie 1985:107).
Archeological cultural classifications in North America consist of a system based primarily
on Gordon Willey and Phillip Phillips’ system outlined in Method and Theory in
Archeology (Kelly and Hurst Thomas 2017:141–143). Willey and Phillips’ work defines
spatial divisions, basic archeological units, temporal series, and integrative units for use in
organizing archeological data to facilitate its interpretation (Willey and Phillips 1958). The
spatial divisions are defined as the locality, varying in size from a single site to a district

16
not larger than might be occupied by a single community; the region, a unit of area loosely
applied but very apt to coincide with minor physiographic subdivisions in which cultural
homogeneity cannot be assumed; and the area, a large spatial unit similar to a cultural area
of the ethnographer like the Southwest in the United States (Willey and Phillips 1958:18–
21). Basic archeological units consist of the phase, a basic unit designed as being limited
spatially to a locality or region and chronologically to the briefest possible amount of time
that is characterized by distinctive and highly specific artifact types that distinguish it from
all similarly conceived units, and the component, defined as the manifestation of a phase
within soil stratum or strata that are presumed to be culturally homogenous (Kelly and
Hurst Thomas 2017:143; Willey and Phillips 1958:21–24). Ideally components are
eventually combined to create broader archeological phases spanning across space (Willey
and Phillips 1958:27). Many phases are associated with specific projectile point and pottery
styles and some extend into multiple regions in practice. Examples of temporal series are
the local sequence, a formerly exclusively soil stratigraphy-based series of components
describing the order in which components are present at a single site or locality; the
regional sequence, the product of correlating similar local sequences at the regional level
that can result in the extension of defined phases across regions; and the period, a relatively
long length of time defined through associations with gross changes in archeological
remains related to highly generalized subsistence methods and material culture (Kelly and
Hurst Thomas 2017:143; Willey and Phillips 1958:24–29). Integrative units consist of the
horizon, a wide distribution of recognizable stylistic characteristics occupying a relatively
brief period of time; the tradition, essentially an archeological manifestation comprised of

17
many phases defined through a broad consistency in observed house styles, settlement
patterns, pottery or lack thereof, and subsistence systems present through a large span of
time; and climax, the phase or phases of maximum cultural intensity of a tradition (Kelly
and Hurst Thomas 2017:142; Willey and Phillips 1958:29–40).
Traditions are sometimes named in association with archeological periods, but often
exceed the bounds of the period they are associated with and can overlap in time and space
with other traditions. People associated with particular phases and traditions are often
referred to as the phase or tradition’s name followed by culture or people or, in some
instances, simply a demonymization of the name itself, with the related term cultural
complex describing an apparent interrelated clustering of cultural traits or characteristics.
The most frequently applied elements of the previously discussed organizational system in
the background research related to this project seem to be the locality, phase, component,
period, and tradition, though sequences are occasionally referenced. It is important to note
that past people that appear to have been using similar artifacts are not definitively part of
common cultures, though their association with each other is often inferred as previously
stated (Anfinson 1979:xi). Though much of the research related to archeology around Red
Wing, Minnesota refers to the culturally occupied space near what is now Red Wing as the
Red Wing Locality, recent research combined with the previously cited terminology
discussed by Willey and Phillips suggests that the Red Wing Region is a more appropriate
classification for the location. Archeological materials suggest the permanent and longterm presence of multiple distinct groups, thus invalidating locality as a potential
taxonomic unit (Schirmer in preparation:4). Cited research referring to an inappropriately

18
named Red Wing Locality has been adjusted in this research to refer to the Red Wing
Region.
Prior to listing and briefly describing archeological sites within set distances of the
project’s area of investigation, identified using the Minnesota Office of the State
Archaeologist’s web portal, a review of a portion of the interpreted archeological timeline
and archeological research related to southeastern Minnesota’s human past, is warranted
to ensure a clearer understanding of archeological data discussed in a more detailed
manner. The Paleoindian Period in Minnesota, spanning from ~9500 – 6000 BCE, was its
first period of human occupation that is supported by archeological evidence (Arzigian and
Stevenson 2003:74; Fleming 2009:2). Beginning around 9500 BCE, wide-ranging huntergathers lived in an environment in transition, as glaciers that once covered the landscape
retreated. The artifacts most commonly affiliated with the period’s associated Paleoindian
Tradition are long, sometimes fluted, lanceolate points used to hunt large fauna, including
mammoth and mastodon early in the period (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:74; Fleming
2009:2). In the late Paleoindian Period and early Archaic Period global temperature began
to rise significantly, ~5°F, reaching a relative high during the Climatic Optimum at ~5800
BCE, transforming many formerly wooded areas, in what is now Minnesota, into prairie
(Gibbon 2012:66). The Archaic Period, spanned from ~6000 – 1000 BCE generally and
~6000 to ~500 or 0 BCE in Minnesota (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:75). The associated
Archaic Tradition is characterized by regional differentiation in material culture and
apparent adaptations in hunting and gathering techniques that took advantage of a greater
number of resources, some of which were specific to particular landforms in various

19
ecological zones, including many species of freshwater fish, mussels, nuts, and berries,
with the main animal resource being deer in wooded areas and bison on the plains (Arzigian
and Stevenson 2003:75). The Woodland Period ranges from ~500 BCE or ~0 CE – 1000
or 1650 CE in Minnesota with the period ending far more quickly in southeastern
Minnesota than in remote northern parts of Minnesota (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:79).
The period’s associated Woodland Tradition is characterized by the broad onset, creation,
and usage of pottery, burial mounds, the bow and arrow, and horticulture (Arzigian and
Stevenson 2003:79).
People residing in southeastern Minnesota during its Late Woodland Period, ~500 – 1100
CE, may be effectively described as belonging to regional and sub-regional groups, with
heterogeneous archeological traits, possessing local knowledge and wide-ranging trading
and interaction networks spanning Minnesota, from Wisconsin to the Dakotas, and spilling
south, well into what is now Iowa and Illinois (Hildebrant Iffert 2010:38 and 43; Schirmer
2002:5 and 36–37). These people, referred to as Late Woodland cultural groups, are
inconsistently archeologically documented in southeastern Minnesota’s Driftless Area,
possibly due to their relatively mobile and dispersed lifeway (Gibbon and Dobbs 1991,
302). As a result, little is known specifically about Late Woodland cultural groups in the
Red Wing Region. Broadly speaking, warm weather lowland villages associated with
primarily hunting and gathering, including shellfish collection, and some small scale crop
production, like the cultivation of goosefoot, knotweed, sunflower, maize, and squash; and
cold weather dispersed mobile sheltered-upland-based family camps, allowing for more
effective deer hunting, comprise the known pattern of regional Late Woodland cultural

20
subsistence (Hildebrant Iffert 2010:39; Schirmer 2002:36–37). Mound groups regularly
consisting of two to 15 conical, linear, and effigy shaped mounds are indicative of a Late
Woodland cultural origin (Hildebrant Iffert 2010:42). Importantly, Late Woodland cultures
have been regarded as being distinct from the contemporaneous and descendent cultures of
the Oneota, Middle Mississippian, and Middle Missouri traditions (Schirmer 2002:5).
The culturally Late Woodland effigy mound building groups, sometimes referred to
collectively, and arguably too specifically, as the Effigy Mound Tradition or culture,
occupied an area encompassing southern Wisconsin, northwestern Illinois, northeastern
Iowa, and land along the Mississippi River in eastern Minnesota around 1000 CE
(Rosebrough 2010:1; Schirmer 2002:37). Effigy mound building cultures constructed
zoomorphic effigy mounds thought to be associated with adapted alliance rituals of Late
Woodland populations more mobile than their predecessors (Rosebrough 2010:556 and
573). Through the tangible representation of identity, sodality, or social totem, using
upperworld and lowerworld associated animal symbolism related to particular resources,
effigy mounds may have allowed builders to bury their dead in multiple locations, without
returning to communal burial grounds, and claim access to local resources (Rosebrough
2010:573; Schirmer 2002:122). Claims to burial rights and resources were likely
established by people involved in carefully planned mound construction, as following the
completion of effigy mounds, the mounds were regularly obscured with vegetation
preventing future visibility (Rosebrough 2010:573). Five phases are taxonomically
regarded as belonging to a defined Effigy Mound variant: the Keyes Phase in northeastern
Iowa, the Lewis Phase in northwestern Wisconsin, the Eastman Phase in southwestern

21
Wisconsin, the Horicon/Kekoskee Phase in southeastern Wisconsin, and the Des Plaines
Phase in northeastern Illinois (Rosebrough 2010:111). All these phases have traits that set
them apart from each other, but their commonly held characteristics are shell midden
formation, Madison pottery-ware usage, and the use of a specific ceramic motif
(Rosebrough 2010:111).
Multiple zoomorphic mounds were, at one time, present on the Mero village’s terrace, with
others being present throughout the Red Wing Region (Fleming 2009:253; Rosebrough
2010:107–108; Schirmer 2002:57). However, unlike the effigy mounds in what are now
Iowa or Wisconsin that were built in association with other effigy mounds, effigy mounds
in the Red Wing Region are isolated among groups of circular or conical mounds indicating
that effigy mound building near Red Wing was merely a small part of a larger aggregational
mortuary tradition (Fleming 2009:254). Effigy mound building groups manufactured and
used pottery consisting primarily of grit-tempered cord-impressed jars (Rosebrough 2010:2
and 93). The presence of or interaction with effigy mound building cultural groups in the
Red Wing Region is supported by locally recovered pottery sherds (Hildebrant Iffert
2010:39 and 42).
Madison ware, a pottery type, often consisting of vertically cord-marked, sometimes cordwrapped stick impressed, conoidal to sub-conoidal grit-tempered jars with thin walls (4–6
mm.), wide mouths, slightly constricted necks, and straight to slightly out flaring rims,
directly associated with studied effigy mounds, appears to have been used by Late
Woodland people on the Dike archeological site, on Prairie Island, just north of Red Wing
(Anfinson 1979:74; Hildebrant Iffert 2010:39). Late Woodland Angelo Punctated ware,

22
hypothesized to be associated with effigy mound building groups, was recovered at the
Mosquito Terrace archeological site, near the confluence of the Cannon and Mississippi
rivers (Hildebrant Iffert 2010:39; Rosebrough 2010:25). Angelo Punctated pottery consists
of grit-tempered jars with punctates and incised to thin-trailed line decorations in geometric
patterns similar to Mankato Incised pottery affiliated with the Cambria Phase, potentially
indicating that the Lewis Phase associated with Angelo Punctated pottery interacted with
cultural groups on the prairie (Anfinson 1979:51; Fleming 2009:146; Rosebrough
2010:113 and 216). This type of pottery was used after 1000 CE and has been found in
association with Middle Mississippian jars (Rosebrough 2010:113).
Pottery associated with other Late Woodland cultural groups, unaffiliated with effigy
mounds, is also present in the Red Wing Region. Clam River Cord-stamped and Onamialike pottery, present at the Dike site, indicate a southward movement of culturally Late
Woodland peoples into the Red Wing Region from near Lake Mille Lacs in eastern
Minnesota and the Clam River in western Wisconsin (Hildebrant Iffert 2010:39). Clam
River Cord-stamped ware is defined as having grit temper, exterior surface treatment with
a crisscross cord wrapped paddle, a globoid body with rounded shoulders and a constricted
neck, a high neck-rim with outcurve, cord-wrapped stick impressions in simple geometric
patterns in the rim-neck area, and occasionally cord-wrapped stick punctates forming a
border below the geometric patterns (Anfinson 1979:67). Clam River pottery is associated
with non-effigy compound burial mounds (Anfinson 1979:67).
Although regarded as non-local, Late Woodland pottery consisting of Grant Cord
Impressed ware and Fred Edwards Cord Impressed ware with shell tempering, are present

23
at the Mero and Bryan pre-contact village areas near Red Wing, on opposite sides of the
Mississippi River (Fleming 2009:218). The presence of these two pottery types indicates
interaction with Late Woodland peoples with evidence of having resided in southwestern
Wisconsin ~1000 – 1200 CE, when the pottery was likely manufactured (Rosebrough
2010:230). Rosebrough asserts that the use of shell temper indicates that Edwards CordImpressed pottery should be considered a Late Woodland/Middle Mississippian hybrid
pottery type (Rosebrough 2010:233). In discussing the Late Woodland cultural presences
in the Red Wing Region, Schirmer explains that, although some are associated with eastern
and northern groups, the majority are related to south-southeastern, western, and
southwestern Plains/Prairie groups (Schirmer 2002:58).
From ~1050 to ~1300 CE, an area encompassing the confluences of the Wind and
Mississippi, Cannon and Mississippi, and Trimbelle and Mississippi rivers, surrounding
and including what is now Red Wing, Minnesota, was arguably the most densely occupied
area in the Upper Mississippi Valley, with an estimated resident population of more than
500 people and archeological evidence supporting its function as an interaction center
between Late Woodland cultures and Oneota Tradition, Cambria Phase, Middle
Mississippian Tradition, and Silvernale Phase related cultural groups (Fleming 2009:11–
12 and 297; Gibbon and Dobbs 1991:295; Hildebrant Iffert 2010:34; Schirmer 2002:6).
Research focusing on the archeology of the Red Wing Region during this period identifies
more than 6 major village sites present including: Silvernale, Bryan, Belle Creek, Energy
Park, Mero/Diamond Bluff, Double, Bartron, and Adams, and puts forth ~150 people as
the ethnographically supported ideal population size for maintaining social harmony in a

24
relatively egalitarian community, suggesting that the resident population could easily be
greater than 1,000 people (Fleming 2009:12; Hildebrant Iffert 2010:34–35; Schirmer
2002:57). These larger villages affiliated with the previously mentioned time period are
regularly surrounded by mound groups that were of great interest to early antiquarians and
archeologists of Minnesota and the Midwest, with the number of locally present individual
mounds exceeding 2,000 (Fleming 2009:20).
Archeological research pertaining to the Red Wing Region defines the Oneota Tradition as
a cultural manifestation associated with the Upper Mississippi River, having characteristics
including villages located to allow access to multiple econiches and the use of large,
globular, shell-tempered pottery vessels with smoothed surface treatment, high or outslanting rims, tool impressions on rims with occasional rim notches, and rectilinear
decorations made with trailed lines, including chevrons (Anfinson 1979:39–40; Hildebrant
Iffert 2010:49; Schirmer 2002:5). Oneota villages are thought to have mainly been located
on terraces and seasonally occupied, with inhabitants procuring shellfish, bison, and deer,
cultivating maize, squash, beans, tobacco, sunflower, and little barley, and gathering
acorns, walnuts, fruits and berries, and wild rice (Hildebrant Iffert 2010:46). Oneota
emergence is complex, with Oneota presence being established with apparent
independence in both eastern Wisconsin approximately 923 CE and eastern Minnesota
approximately 1050 – 1100 CE and another independent Oneota origin point located in
northeastern Illinois, near Lake Michigan (Fleming 2009; Henning and Schirmer
2020:149–156; Rosebrough 2010; Schirmer 2002, 2016). Oneota artifactual assemblages
comprised the majority of artifacts at the Bartron and Adams archeological village sites in

25
the Red Wing Region and contributed artifacts to the village sites, including multi-cultural
aggregation village sites, on both sides of the Mississippi River near Red Wing. Research
suggests a southerly, later, purer Oneota phase in the Red Wing Region at the Burnside
School and McClelland sites dating to 1222 – 1419 CE at 2-sigma and 1350 – 1400 CE,
respectively, following the large-scale occupation of aggregation village sites (Koncur
2018:13 and 52; Schirmer 2016).
The Middle Mississippian Tradition was centered around the massive pre-contact
population center referred to as Cahokia, near modern day St. Louis, Missouri, and had an
estimated peak population of ~15,000 people, with estimates being as low as under 5,000
people and as high as greater than 40,000 people (Woods 2004:255–256). The Middle
Mississippian cultures, associated with the Emergent Mississippian Period (~800 – 1050
CE) and the Mississippian Period (~1050 – 1350 CE), spread along the Mississippi River
and its tributaries (Fleming 2009:15). Middle Mississippians are probable descendants of
Woodland Tradition related populations from around the American Bottom Region, the
broad 16-kilometer-wide eastern floodplain spanning from the confluence of the Illinois
and Mississippi and Missouri and Mississippi rivers to where the Mississippi floodplain
begins to tighten ~20 km. south of St. Louis (Schirmer 2002:23; Woods 2004:255–256).
These Woodland populations gradually transitioned from living in small unorganized
upland and lowland clusters of houses with a disorganized structure of cooking and storage
pits to highly concentrated, floodplain focused, socially stratified communities with
numerous domestic compounds and a uniform system of pits organized around a central
open space with its own pit cluster surrounding a central post. These communities engaged

26
in task specialization and subsisted using an organized system of large-scale agricultural
food production (Schirmer 2002:5 and 23). Additional characteristics associated with
Middle Mississippian culture include: platform mounds, wall-trench structures, tri-notched
projectile points, chipped stone Middle Mississippian hoes, spades, and knives, discoidals
(also referred to as chunkey stones), pottery trowels, pans, water bottles, and shelltempered pottery with rolled rims and curvilinear decorations (Emerson 1999:224; Fleming
2009:242; Gibbon and Dobbs 1991:288–289).
The Cambria Phase consists of mounds and three core villages along the Minnesota River
(Henning and Schirmer 2020:158). Recent assays date the phase, that includes imitations
of Stirling Phase Cahokia rolled rimmed angled shouldered jars decorated by broad
curvilinear designs, from 1000 – 1200 CE or 1050 – 1200 CE with a later variant dating
from 1200 – 1300 CE (Holley and Michlovic 2013:22). Henning and Toom as well as
Holley and Michlovic indicate that the Cambria Phase falls within the Northeastern Plains
Village Tradition due to its lack of artifacts indicating interaction with Initial Middle
Missouri cultures and its geographic displacement from the Great Oasis Phase that is
purported to have played a role in the genesis of the Initial Middle Missouri Tradition,
which Cambria has been placed within previously (Holley and Michlovic 2013:22–26;
Mollerud 2016:72). The placement of Cambria outside of the Initial Middle Missouri
Tradition is supported by Cambria’s notable similarities to the Mill Creek and Over phases
to the west and the Silvernale and Cahokia phases to the east (Holley and Michlovic
2013:26). However, Mollerud identifies four Great Oasis rim sherds at the Cambria Phase
type site (Mollerud 2016:182). Other characteristics of the Cambria Phase include: plains

27
side-notched projectile points, semi-subterranean house forms, bell shaped storage pits,
snub-nosed thumbnail scrapers, sandstone abraders, pottery gaming pieces, scapulae hoes,
clay elbow pipes, and quantities of bone, shell, and maize refuse (Anfinson 1979:51;
Gibbon and Dobbs 1991:303). Over 93.7% of 442 individual vessels analyzed through rim
sherds from the Cambria type site were fragments of grit-tempered jars that had a smoothed
surface treatment with nearly half exhibiting evidence for polish, reflecting light (Mollerud
2016:98, 113, and 180). Decorative designs associated with the Cambria Phase are incised
or trailed, with occasional punctates and rare cord impressions, and are mainly comprised
of linate horizontal fields, chevrons, meanders, spirals, and filled triangles (Anfinson
1979:51). The Cambria Phase shares a host of vessel shapes and rim and decorative
treatments with neighbors to the south and west (Holley and Michlovic 2013:22).
The Silvernale Phase (~1100 – 1300 CE), has its type site within the Red Wing Region and
is present in both southeastern Minnesota and extreme western Wisconsin. Artifact and
feature characteristics associated with this phase are small notched and unnotched
triangular projectile points, end scrapers, side scrapers, sandstone arrow shaft abraders,
bison scapula hoes, storage and refuse pits, and flexed primary burials in subsurface pits
with an indicated mixed hunting and gathering and agricultural economy (Anfinson
1979:183; Gibbon and Dobbs 1991:298). Village sites of this phase reside on terraces
above the floodplains of the Cannon and Mississippi rivers (Fleming 2009:23). Silvernale
culture seemed to disappear from the Upper Midwest by 1300 CE following the collapse
of Cahokia and the affiliated Middle Mississippian Tradition with the disappearance
posited as resulting from Red Wing Region Silvernale groups disaggregating due to their

28
function as a prairie-related trading node in a wide-spread Middle Mississippian trading
network no longer being necessary (Gibbon and Dobbs 1991:301). Recent research has
concluded that formerly aggregated groups moved away from the Mississippi trench at the
end of the Silvernale Phase and created villages near more minor drainages in the Red
Wing Region, identified as Oneota (Henning and Schirmer 2020:151). Village sites that
have a majority Silvernale component are Silvernale, Bryan, Belle Creek, Energy Park,
and Mero/Diamond Bluff (Hildebrant Iffert 2010:35).
Shell tempering is by far the most commonly identified temper type for Silvernale pottery
and its surfaces are typically wiped smooth with some vessels, usually formed from
incompletely oxidized grayish paste, appearing to have exhibited polish (Holley in
preparation:10). Whole and nearly complete Silvernale vessels invariably have hachured
scrolls and Silvernale nested chevrons were very often rounded or curving as opposed to
rigid (Holley in preparation:11).
Isolated scrolls and hachured units… were identified, sometimes in
association with parallel horizontal lines. Finally, a bull’s-eye, possibly a
variant of the scroll, was identified in Silvernale deposits as were sherds
with seemingly unbounded rounded punctations (Holley in preparation:11).
Holley identifies some of the diagnostic aspects of the Silvernale I facet of Silvernale
pottery as weakly protruding rolled-rim jars or faceted-rim jars with plain or polished black
surfaces and moderate width with deeply scribed decoration on angled-shoulder bodies.
The archetypal pottery vessels within the Silvernale II facet are rolled-rim jars, sometimes
having large rims, with wide scribed decoration with strong intaglio-effect on the interior
wall (Holley in preparation:16).

29
Diagnostic characteristics of Link pottery, a pottery type related to the Silvernale Phase,
include angled-rim and curved-neck jars, intermediately angled to rounded shoulders, and
rim tabs, which are clay pads added to the rim as a form of decoration that follow the flow
or direction of the rim (Holley in preparation:17–18). Link scribed decorations resemble
the previously discussed Silvernale facets’ filling in large areas of the upper jar, but
sometimes have disconnected scrolls or spirals and large areas of the vessel undecorated
(Holley in preparation:18). Recent results from the Silvernale site date Bartron pottery, an
Oneota pottery, at ca. 1170 – 1280 CE and Silvernale and Link pottery at ca. 1190 – 1240
CE indicating that multiple pottery types appear to have been in use at the same time over
a period of 100 years (Henning and Schirmer 2020:154). The new data support Oneota
cultural development being a process separate from Middle Mississippian-related activities
(Henning and Schirmer 2020:154).
Project Area of Investigation Archeological Background and Selection Rationale
The Belle Creek Mounds archeological site was chosen as the focal point of this research
due to it having features representative of other mound groups on PIIC’s newly acquired
property, as well as greater prominence and relatively easy accessibility, which facilitates
study and makes adverse effects to its already impacted mounds more probable. Through
studying the geophysical results associated with a highly visible mound group, other
mounds within less prominent mound groups will likely be easier to identify through
comparison with data collected at Belle Creek Mounds.

30
There are 166 recorded archeological sites in Minnesota within 10 km. of the Belle Creek
Mounds archeological site (Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist 2021a). Eightyseven of the 166 recorded archeological sites are classified as sites encompassing burial
mounds, and 16 of the sites are documented as confirmed locations of former aboriginal
habitation or village locations. Some of the sites formally classified as villages are
associated with different archeologically derived cultures and traditions that include
Woodland, Oneota, and Middle Mississippian, affiliated most strongly with Silvernale
Phase groups.
Within 1 km. of the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site there are 9 recorded
archeological sites (Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist 2021a). Eight of the sites
are areas encompassing small mound groups, with fewer than 5 identified mounds, and 1
of the sites is referred to in name as Belle Creek Village. The northeastern portion of the
Belle Creek Village’s site boundary encompasses the southwestern third of the Belle Creek
Mounds site. The property, upon which the northern portion of the Belle Creek Mounds
site (21GD0072) resides, is now owned by the Prairie Island Indian Community (PIIC)
along with two complete archeological sites, McGregor Mounds I (21GD0066) and
McGregor Mounds II (21GD0067), and portions of three other archeological sites,
McGregor Mounds III (21GD0068), Foreman Mounds (21GD0065), and Belle Creek
Village (21GD0200) (Figure 2-3) (Goodhue County 2020; Minnesota Department of
Transportation 2017).

31

PIIC’s newly acquired property.
The mound sites located on PIIC’s property, apart from the Belle Creek Mounds site, are
relatively small and do not encompass many mounds. The Foreman Mounds site is
documented as having 3 mounds on 0.81 hectares of land, McGregor Mounds I is
documented as having 4 mounds on 1.82 hectares of land, McGregor Mounds II is
documented as having 3 mounds on 1.42 hectares of land, and McGregor Mounds III is
documented as having 1 mound on 0.4 hectares of land (Minnesota State Historic
Preservation Office 1990a, 1990b, 1990c, 1990d). All of these sites are assigned as having
a probable cultural-temporal affiliation with the Woodland Tradition. The Belle Creek
Village site is documented as having associated depressions, pottery, and debitage, and as

32
occupying 25.1 hectares of land within and south and west of the Belle Creek Mounds site
(Minnesota Department of Transportation 2017; Minnesota Office of the State
Archaeologist 2021a; Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office 1990e). The Belle
Creek Village is documented as being associated with the Oneota Tradition along with a
high probability of being associated with the Mississippian Tradition (Minnesota State
Historic Preservation Office 1990e).
The interpretations present on Belle Creek Village’s site form are likely derived from an
excavation done on the site with cursory documentation. In the Minnesota Office of the
State Archaeologist’s (OSA’s) site files there is digitized correspondence written by former
State Archaeologist Elden Johnson in which he describes flying over the Belle Creek
Village site, seeing [Pre-Contact Era] house outlines, and, eventually, conducting a test
excavation on the site that “produced a few pottery sherds much like those from the Bryan
site downstream” (Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist 2021b). Because Bryan is
a complex aggregation site with multiple types of local pottery, Johnson’s description of
the pottery at Belle Creek is unclear. Johnson went on to note that Belle Creek Village
offers a good opportunity to potentially answer some of the questions raised at Bryan, but
that could not be answered due its level of destruction (Minnesota Office of the State
Archaeologist 2021b). Although the aforementioned excavation is informally documented
by Johnson, a more detailed summary or report of the work could not be located and does
not seem to have ever existed (Schirmer 2020, personal communication).
An 1885 effort to map mounds is the only previous formally documented archeological
survey that had taken place investigating Belle Creek Mounds. Because of the site’s gross

33
characteristics (i.e., position on the landscape and pattern of mounds), it is thought to be
associated with the Silvernale Phase or the Bartron Phase Oneota regional occupation,
whose artifacts are present at mound sites along major drainages near Red Wing,
Minnesota (Gibbon and Dobbs 1991). With Johnson’s interpretation in mind, the most
likely nearby sites that may reveal what to expect in terms of cultural affiliation and
archeological deposits at Belle Creek Mounds would also have villages in close association
with mound groups on terraces along the Cannon River and possibly the Mississippi River,
villages like Bryan (21GD0004) and Area 51 (21GD0290) and mound groups like Bryan
Mounds (21GD0045) and Bryan II (21GD0051) (Minnesota Office of the State
Archaeologist 2021a).
Another informally documented excavation took place at Belle Creek Mounds
archeological site prior to Johnson’s excavation in the late 1960’s or 1970. Dr. Edward W.
Schmidt assisted in excavating and documented the excavation of a “six-foot conical
mound” that had load marks and contained 3 dozen cobblestones at varied depths, but no
other evidence of human presence (Schmidt 1940). Schmidt also excavated a “62 foot
mound that was 3 feet high at its eastern end but older looking at its western end” (Schmidt
1940). Schmidt’s excavation located a spall with chipping at the far western end of the
mound during the excavation of a 12-foot trench. In the eastern end of the mound,
excavators found bone fragments. Then after hours of careful digging, recovered larger
human bone fragments from above the hips, a femur and tibia of a right leg, as well as
small bits of cranium, but no ribs, hand bones, or foot bones (Schmidt 1940). Further
analysis of the previously mentioned remains, once part of the H188 Goodhue County

34
Historical Society collection that were originally accessioned as 2413 – 2426, reveal that
the remains are associated with a minimum of four individuals (Blue in preparation). The
remains indicate the presence of one probable adult male, a possible adult female, and two
sub-adults associated with skull fragments, a clavicle, and sacral fragments (Blue in
preparation). The skull fragments and clavicle associated with one of the sub-adults exhibit
copper staining (Blue in preparation). Schmidt also discussed a mound in an alfalfa field
at Belle Creek that contained pieces of charcoal that “could not possibly have been
introduced by roots or animals” and circular and rectangular depressions on the eastern
portion of the terrace that were surrounded by low embankments, possible hut rings, but
excavation could not confirm the depressions as such. Though Schmidt’s informal
excavation of mounds is now seen as unethical, the associated documentation of the
features within the mounds at the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site gives a modern
survey a better idea of what mounds contain and how nearby human made mounds might
be distinguished from natural landforms.
On September 28th and 29th of 1885, archeologist and surveyor T.H. Lewis mapped 67
mounds at Belle Creek Mounds long before the archeological site was formally established
(Lewis 1885:1–3). When looking at a LiDAR derived digital elevation model (DEM)
colored hillshade, Lewis’ work appears to accurately reflect the various mound locations
within the Belle Creek Mounds site’s mound group (Figure 2-4). When comparing Lewis’
1885 mound survey to the previously mentioned hillshade, agricultural practices look to
have disturbed 22 of the mounds documented in the 1880’s, while 45 of the mounds seem
to have avoided cultivation. Horse drawn scrapers could be used to quickly remove mound

35
fill (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:57). However, some of the uncultivated mounds appear
to have been looted. A preliminary survey and the appearance of the mounds on the
hillshade confirm the presence of fairly recently dug human-made pits in the centers of 13
of the mounds on site. Thirty-two mounds appear intact and undisturbed. Approximately
0.6 hectares of the 2.5 hectares that seem to have been under cultivation on 21GD0072
were recently in use as a hay field.

Mound and Geophysical Background
The reasons attributed to local mound construction and its cessation are discussed in
research related to the Red Wing Region and broader area. Community and Aggregation in
the Upper Mississippi River Valley contends that mounds were not necessarily territorial
markers, but symbols of cultural interaction and ritual linked to cultural aggregation related
events (Fleming 2009:234). Another hypothesis explains mound building and burials as
part of a corporate social strategy to decrease resource related risks across cultural groups
through establishing shared symbolic claims to resources in multiple areas that waned with
the onset of horticultural sedentism in favor of then more useful network-based social
strategies associated with the use of individual burials containing grave goods (Rosebrough
2010:110 and 239). A poor understanding of mound composition and contents makes
mound documentation difficult. In order to better understand the internal structure and
physical nature of Native American mounds, archeologists Constance Arzigian and
Katherine Stevenson compiled and analyzed data from all well-documented mound
excavations in Minnesota (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:1). However, detailed information
related to mound excavations is fairly difficult to come by, as no excavations have been
done for solely scientific purposes since the early 1970’s, when legislation began to legally
protect mounds from human disturbance (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:1). Also, Arzigian
and Stevenson found that early surveyors who mapped mounds sometimes mistook natural
or Euro-American features as Native American mounds and occasionally failed to map
some of the mounds within surveyed mound groups (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:56).

38
Artifacts within or near mounds are not necessarily associated with the construction period
of a mound. Not only are mounds constructed over the course of decades and centuries, but
people have used village fill containing artifacts associated with time periods and cultural
groups existing hundreds to thousands of years earlier than the mound construction event(s)
to build mounds (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:61). Mounds often contain burials and
artifacts that were added to them hundreds of years after they were constructed. The most
reliable method of dating a burial feature is the identification of intentionally placed
diagnostic artifacts or directly associated radiometrically dateable material (Arzigian and
Stevenson 2003:104).
Mounds frequently contain primary burials and secondary burials interred one of four
ways: in pits below the ground surface; placed on the ground surface and covered; placed
in a pit dug into an existing mound and buried; or placed on top of an existing mound and
buried by making the mound larger (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:168). Secondary burials
have been posited as a potentially non-cultural seasonal practice when the ground is frozen,
making immediate burial difficult (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:228). Burials are more
common near the center of a mound but can occur out to nearly the margin of the mound.
Arzigian and Stevenson’s research showed confirmed burials as being present within
75.9% (217) of 286 well-documented mounds with only 2.8% (8) of mounds not having
any evidence of burials present (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:232). Eighty-seven-and-ahalf percent of studied mounds greater than 3 feet in height contained burials with none of
them confirmed as being negative for a burial (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:194). The few

39
mounds excavated in the Red Wing Region have contained human burials (Fleming
2009:253).
Features within mounds are nearly equally split between three vertical positions: in fill, on
the original ground surface, and in pits in subsoil (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:169).
Burial features had a maximum depth of ~3 ft. or ~0.9 meters. below the original ground
surface in archeological region 3e where the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site
resides, with the maximum statewide depth being slightly greater than 6 ft. or ~1.85 meters
(Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:177). The most common types of features in burial mounds
are: pits, which are identifiable due to their dark stained fill contrasting with lighter
surrounding subsoil; human remains interred without a visible pit; a cluster of bundle
burials; a special burial complex; pit interred human remains; fireplaces/hearths;
rocks/cairns; animal bones; cremated human remains; caches; scattered human remains;
charcoal; clay ridges; stone vaults; and lithic concentrations (Arzigian and Stevenson
2003:156). There are also occasionally logs documented above burials. The pits included
in the study averaged ~5 ft. x ~4 ft. x ~2 ft. or 1.5 meters x 1.2 meters x 0.6 meters.
The soils on and around mounds differ from their less altered surroundings. At Effigy
Mounds National Monument, mounds have stripped topsoil at their bases resulting in
truncated soil strata around the mound’s base (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:134). Mound
A horizons have shown that they can stabilize relatively quickly, within 1,000 years, of
mixed topsoil and subsoil being deposited from areas where fill is taken (Arzigian and
Stevenson 2003:125). This results in a thicker A horizon on top of the mound than the
borrow area surrounding the mound from where fill was taken. However, E and B horizons

40
within the mound fill do not develop as rapidly. The borrow areas have been documented
as having A horizons roughly half as thick as the surrounding soils more than 100 feet
away from mounds (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:126).
Arzigian and Stevenson’s discussion of how mound groups change their area’s soil
horizonation draws attention to the anthropogenic driven alterations to mound fill borrow
areas among mound groups. The negative space created by borrow areas likely contribute
to the local relief, increasing elevation differences between mounds and their surroundings,
contributing to the appearance of the mounds themselves. Through Arzigian and
Stevenson’s research it can be inferred that borrow areas among mound groups could
contribute to mound relocation through comparisons of soil horizon thicknesses. Some of
the previously reviewed research emphasizes the significance of the areas between
mounds, within mound groups. Rosebrough writes:
Ritual at mound centers was not likely to have been limited to the mounds
themselves. Earthen enclosures are sometimes found adjacent to the mound
groups. Large pits have been noted in patterned association with mounds at
the only two sites where significant inter-mound areas have been stripped
of sod (Rosebrough 2010:96).
Rosebrough goes on to emphasize that studies have not been done to confirm the breadth
of ritual practices associated with mound groups and that previous research has neglected
the space between mounds (Rosebrough 2010:96). Community and Aggregation in the
Upper Mississippi River Valley: The Red Wing Locality describes mound groups
surrounding aggregation villages near Red Wing as cemeteries, tacitly emphasizing mound
groups’ complex social function as a whole (Fleming 2009:305).

41
The Belle Creek Mounds archeological site’s mound group is characterized as the least
disturbed mound group in the Red Wing Region and is possibly representative of the
appearance of other mound groups if they had escaped cultivation (Yamada 2007:46).
Several developed techniques, related to geographic information systems, were used on
this project to more effectively identify, digitize, and estimate mound locations on the Belle
Creek Mounds site. One technical procedure relating to determining the locations of
mounds surveyed in the 1880’s, using a compass and canvas measuring tapes, consists of:
determining a mound group location with noted legal descriptions, georeferenced aerial
photography, and visualizable digital elevation datasets, as well as notes collected during
the original survey; converting noted bearing direction based shots from mound to mound
into azimuths; subtracting magnetic declination to convert azimuths into true north related
directional azimuths, as opposed to magnetic north related directional azimuths; and,
finally, building a digital mound group, using calculated true north related azimuths and
the distances documented between mounds in the original survey notes, through creating
connected digital lines corresponding to the determined directions and distances (Yamada
2007:31–32). At individual and shared vertices of the created surveying shot lines where
mounds are indicated in the survey notes, relatively accurate geospatial representations of
mounds can be created by building a digital polygon corresponding to survey noted
measured mound lengths, widths, or radii.
Other research was used to improve the accuracy of the process of building digital
geospatial representations of individual mounds at approximated or verified mound group
locations. In attempting to locate mounds within the approximate area that the original

42
mound survey described, a method was used in which a LiDAR derived hillshade was
overlain by a partially transparent colored DEM, with different coloring representing small
changes in elevation, to ensure that small rises on the represented landscape depicting
mounds were not obscured by larger rises due to the specific lighting angle of the hillshade
(Artz et al. 2013:17). This technique was used to more accurately locate mounds which the
previously mentioned digital geospatial representations of mound groups needed to be tied
to for a spatially accurate depiction of a mound group to be achieved. Using dynamic range
adjustment to allow the coloration of the DEM to represent different ranges of elevations
upon zooming or panning within ArcMap 10.7 was helpful in locating individual mounds.
Because mounds have spiritual significance and legal protection against their disturbance
due to their regular association with burials, inherently low-impact geophysical techniques,
which use the properties of magnetism and electromagnetic radiation in prospection and
analysis, can be highly effective and appropriate in mound related research. Archeologists
typically use geophysical methods to measure physical properties of near-surface deposits
within 2 meters of the ground surface, usually to attempt to locate or define features of
cultural origin (Kvamme et al. 2006:45). An area’s soil properties can greatly affect the
utility of different geophysical methods (Kvamme et al. 2006:45). The main geophysical
methods used in archeology, three of which are used in this project, are: electrical
resistivity, magnetometry, electromagnetic induction, and ground penetrating radar
(Kvamme et al. 2006:45). It is important to note that geophysics involves the interpretation
of detected differences in collected geospatially specific data, referred to as anomalies,
from small sections of a broad area over which geophysical data were collected at set

43
intervals. As archeological features regularly have different physical and chemical
properties than the soils that surround them, geophysical data anomalous to their
surroundings can be used to assist in interpreting archeological sites and features (Kvamme
et al. 2006:45).
Resistivity or relative soil resistance survey involves introducing a known electrical current
into soil and measuring and recording the ease at which the current flows through the soil
at specific points in space by measuring a drop in voltage between probes in contact with
the ground (Somers 2006:113). The electrical resistance measurement is traditionally
represented in ohms. The electrical resistance measured by the equipment used to conduct
a resistivity or relative soil resistance survey indicates an average electrical resistance of
all of the soil the current injected into the soil passes through on its way to a probe
associated with measuring resistance via voltage drop (Somers 2006:113). These
measurements are usually recorded at regular intervals across a site to locate areas with
geophysically anomalous readings in relation to more widely prevalent ranges of readings
across a surveyed area. Soil moisture, soil grain size, temperature, soil compaction, and
soil salinity contribute to the electrical resistance of a particular portion of a soil matrix
(Somers 2006:111). Anomalous areas of high resistance in relative soil resistance data can
be associated with buried walls, mounds, banks, cobbled areas, rubble filled pits, and
underground voids. Anomalous areas of low resistance are often associated with ditches,
soil filled pits, hut circles, foundation trenches, and gullies (Geoscan Research 2009:6-3).
Buried archeological features with higher amounts of organic material than the surrounding
soil matrix often retain relatively more moisture making them lower in electrical resistance

44
where as those with less organic material (e.g., a refuse pit with a large amount of stone
debris) often appear as resistance highs (Somers 2006:120). Variations in soils, sediments,
and geology are also apparent in resistivity surveys (Somers 2006:118). Relative soil
resistance survey results, like other geophysical methods’ survey results, can vary in
seemingly counter-intuitive and difficult to predict ways making related interpretations of
anomalies as specific archeological features tentative (Cuenca-Garcia 2019:70).
Magnetometry passively measures local variations in the earth’s magnetic field near the
ground surface, with a practical limit of ~3m in depth (Kvamme 2006:206 and 222).
Common causes of detected variation in soil magnetism include: differences in the
magnetic susceptibilities of various deposits and soils, the magnetic enrichment of topsoil
resulting from chemical and physical processes like weathering and biogenic processes
involving bacterial excretion of the magnetic material magnetite, and firing increasing
magnetism due to the thermoremanent effect, in which the normally randomly oriented
magnetic domains in the iron oxides of soils, clays, or stones become aligned to earth’s
magnetic field at the time of firing at above 600 degrees Celsius. Magnetic domains in a
material’s iron oxides freeze in a reset magnetic alignment during and after cooling,
following the material reaching 600 degrees Celsius (Kvamme 2006:207 and 214). With
respect to the previously mentioned causes of magnetic variation, human activities that
reveal why magnetometry is a useful tool in archeological prospection include: people
making fires, people making constructions and artifacts from fired materials, human
occupation increasing the magnetic enrichment of surface soils, human constructions
accumulating topsoil, human constructions removing topsoil, people importing materials

45
for constructions, and people making and using iron artifacts (Kvamme 2006:216–221).
Cultural anomalies often show up as geometric shapes, including lines, circles, and
rectangles, in magnetometry survey data as well as in other types of geophysical data
(Kvamme 2006:222). Mounds may be represented as anomalies with high magnetism due
to their likely association with the accumulation of anthropogenically altered topsoil or the
burned prepared surfaces they are often built upon (Betts and Stay 2017:49–50; Kvamme
2006:217–218).
Ground Penetrating Radar sends radar waves into the ground through a surface antenna
that are then reflected off of buried objects, features, bedding contacts, or soil units and
detected by a receiving antenna (Conyers 2006:136). As radar pulses are transmitted
through the ground their velocity changes depending on the physical and chemical
properties of the material they travel through (Conyers 2006:136). The more significant the
contrast in electrical properties of two materials at a subsurface interface, the greater the
strength, amplitude, of a detected reflected signal associated with the interface (Conyers
2006:136). This geophysical method has the ability to produce high resolution 3dimensional subsurface data due to radar waves’ known speed being able to be converted
to distance below the ground and the waves’ capability to continue to propagate through
the ground following their partial reflection by velocity changes associated with shallower
fluctuations in subsurface material’s electrical properties (Conyers 2006:136). Areas
associated with the reception of low amplitude reflections usually indicate a uniform soil
matrix (Conyers 2006:142). Hyperbolas visible in ground-penetrating radar related
reflection profiles are generated because energy is recorded from a high contrast point

46
source before and after the receiving antenna is directly above the aforementioned point
source, which is represented by the apex of a hyperbola (Conyers 2006:137).
Reflections occur at buried discontinuities where there are changes in the
electrical properties of the sediment or soil, variations in water content,
lithologic changes, or changes in bulk density. Reflections can also be
produced at interfaces between anomalous archaeological features and the
surrounding soil or sediment. Void spaces in the ground such as caskets in
cemeteries, tunnels, and buried pipes or conduits made of either metal or
plastic will also generate strong radar reflections as a result of a significant
change in radar-wave velocity. These features tend to produce reflection
hyperbolas generated from a distinct “point feature” in the
subsurface…(Conyers 2006:136)
Non-invasive geophysical methods including relative soil resistance, magnetometry, and
ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were used throughout the area of investigation to
attempt to identify geophysical anomalies present on site. The various areas of
investigation consist of intact mounds, mounds disturbed by cultivation, areas between
mounds, and areas between mounds and the mound group’s apparent boundary on site.
Through analyzing the size, shape, location, and the relationship geophysical anomalies
have with each other and the visible environment, later analyses of the collected data will
be able to facilitate the development of interpretations of what identified anomalies indicate
and the broader implications of those indications.
Advocates for using geophysical survey as a primary method of archeological investigation
for architecture and landscape-based research think that non-invasive geophysical survey
can be used as far more than a prospective tool to assist in successful archeological
excavations (Thompson et al. 2011: 197–198). They cite identification of: construction
variation in the built environment, continuities and discontinuities in the use of space,

47
natural and cultural modifications to the landscape, and regularities in the use of space and
architecture at a regional level, as information that analyses of geophysical anomalies can
potentially contribute to studies of past people without necessarily requiring the application
of other investigatory methods (Thompson et al. 2011:197–198). Through analyzing
geophysical anomalies, geophysicists can make inferences about how past people used and
viewed space. One small example of geophysical interpretation would be interpreting a
low-resistance oval shaped anomaly below a mound as a likely mortuary feature, like a
burial or offering pit, or the result of previous physical examination or testing.
The current project applies the previously mentioned conceptual methods of geophysical
anomaly interpretation later in this thesis. Application of these methods stands to increase
understanding about how the Belle Creek Mounds site was used in the past and what areas
of the site may warrant protection, including future avoidance of ground disturbance, due
to areas of the ground’s geophysically anomalous profiles that suggest the possible
presence of buried culturally sensitive material.
As alluded to previously, in order to better understand the archeological built environment
at the Belle Creek Mounds site, geophysical data were collected on mounds, places
identified as the former locations of now highly disturbed mounds, spaces between
mounds, and areas with no visible mounds, not identified as previously having mounds by
Lewis’ 1885 survey. These data allow for the comparison and interpretation of the
geophysical profiles of these different types of features on the landscape and contribute
information related to the construction processes and compositions of various types of
mounds and the geophysical appearances of likely culturally and naturally built features.

48
The amount and quality of conducted archeological research limits understanding of the
Red Wing Region’s archeological record. Archeologists have excavated very little of the
culturally complex major archeological village sites in the Red Wing Region in relation to
their total mapped areas, while using inconsistent documentation methods (Schirmer and
Fleming in preparation). In some instances, Middle and Late Woodland components have
been mostly destroyed by later occupations (Schirmer and Fleming in preparation).
Archeologists have not performed research on some of the known archeological sites in the
region due to accessibility difficulties. The Belle Creek Mounds site is one of the sites that
was, until recently, inaccessible to archeologists. Due to the lack of archeological
information pertaining specifically to the Belle Creek Mounds site, it was essential to
provide an interpretive context based on nearby archeological sites and a review of local
archeological research. Keeping an open mind about what archeological evidence may be
present is important in avoiding biasing the interpretation of collected data and preventing
the destruction of previously unknown archeology.
Establishing the area of investigation within the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site
boundary allowed the interpretation of the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site as being
associated with a village site, as other large nearby mound sites are, to be preliminarily
tested. Members of the Minnesota State University, Mankato (MSU, Mankato) ESRL’s
archeological surveying team visited the site twice, prior to when fieldwork was planned,
to gain a better understanding of how best to go about conducting a survey for the purpose
of developing a site treatment plan. One of these visits involved a walkthrough with PIIC
Land and Environment and Tribal Historic Preservation Office staff to help establish

49
appropriate field procedures and gauge the amount of time and equipment needed to
perform fieldwork. The primary concern the ESRL archeological surveying team and PIIC
staff addressed during their collective walkthrough related to brush clearing in preparation
for geophysical data collection.

50
Chapter 3 – Methodology
The initial generational step in preparing for fieldwork, related to the development of an
archeological site treatment plan, at the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site involved
creating shapefiles approximating the locations of visible and non-visible mounds, as well
as Prairie Island Indian Community’s property boundary in relation to the previously
mentioned archeological site on PIIC’s newly acquired property. Members of the ESRL’s
archeological surveying crew used ArcMap 10.7.1 software in combination with: a LiDAR
derived hillshade, a LiDAR derived digital elevation model (DEM), T.H. Lewis’ notes
from an 1885 survey of the mound group, satellite imagery from Mapbox, property
boundary data from the Goodhue County GIS Office, and archeological site boundary data
from the State of Minnesota to generate the aforementioned shapefiles.
Using previously discussed geospatial datasets, archeological surveying crew members Dr.
Ronald Schirmer, and the author, Alexander Anton were able to determine a viable area of
investigation (AOI) to attempt to fulfill the research goals necessary to develop an informed
site treatment plan safely within PIIC’s property boundary. A 40 x 100-meter AOI was
settled upon due to the anticipated difficulty of removing large amounts of brush and fallen
trees (Schirmer 2020, email message to author, May 28th). The AOI’s location
encompassed adversely impacted mounds, relatively undisturbed mounds, area between
mounds, and mound-free area in its southernmost portions. Schirmer thought it appropriate
to attempt to collect data over a large rectangular contiguous area as it would be easier to
track (Schirmer 2020, email message to author, May 29th). Schirmer additionally advised

51
the collection of geophysical data between mounds to provide data possibly allowing for
interpretation as to how past people used those areas as well as the vicinity of the mound
group as a whole (Schirmer 2020, conversation with author, April 21st). The AOI is
divisible into 20 x 20-meter squares facilitating the collection of geophysical data. An
additional 20 x 20-meter grid portion was added onto the western edge of the
northwesternmost 20 x 20-meter grid portion in the original AOI to attempt to collect
geophysical data over a likely highly impacted mound within the pasture area previously
used as a hay field.
After ESRL archeological crew members determined a viable AOI, crew members used
ArcMap 10.7.1 software to fishnet the AOI creating digital, geospatially located 20 x 20meter squares. The corners of each 20 x 20-meter square were then turned into points with
geospatial, UTM coordinates to aid in the tangible establishment of each 20 x 20-meter
square’s corners during fieldwork.
The initial task done at the beginning of fieldwork involved transporting the materials
needed for brush clearing and archeological surveying from MSU, Mankato to an
unloading area within PIIC’s new property’s boundary, above the terrace that Belle Creek
Mounds archeological site resides upon. Two pickup trucks and two cars owned by
archeological surveying crew members were used in initial transportation of the materials.
A UTV operated by PIIC Compliance Officer Franky Jackson then transported the
materials down to the terrace upon which the determined AOI resides. ESRL Geospatial
Data Manager Andrew Brown constructed a 4 ft. x 8 ft. x 3 ft. padlock-able box, out of 2inch x 3-inch boards for the frame and oriented strand board (OSB) to cover all of its sides,

52
which when covered with a large tarp, could keep sensitive and expensive equipment safe
and dry on site. Franky Jackson provided a game camera to monitor activity in the vicinity
of the locked box while the crew was off site for added security. The box allowed the crew
to avoid multiple trips transporting materials from parking areas to the AOI or vice versa
before work could start and end each day.
Following transporting equipment on site, the ESRL crew approximated the location of all
of the 20-meter x 20-meter grid portion corners within the original 40 x 100-meter AOI,
using a Trimble Geo7x GNSS receiver. The ESRL archeological field crew, consisting of
Dr. Ronald Schirmer, Andrew Brown, Anna Wiitanen-Eggen, Luke Burds, and Alexander
Anton, used plastic stakes to mark the approximate location of each of the original eighteen
20 x 20-meter grid portion corners and flagging tape on a tree selected near each stake to
make the locations of the stakes visible through the thick brush initially located throughout
most of the AOI. These staked and flagged GNSS receiver-based approximations, though
not sub-meter accurate, allowed for work on brush clearing to begin without the
establishment of permanent physical datums near the AOI.
In the next four days of fieldwork following the informal establishment of the location of
the desired gridded AOI, the ESRL archeological surveying crew, Franky Jackson, and
PIIC’s Native Food Sovereignty Fellow Esther Lui, as well as Franky’s brother Matt
Jackson and, for a half of a day, journalist Casey Ek, cleared brush, fallen trees, and small
standing trees from the AOI to allow for the collection of geophysical data. Gabe Miller,
PIIC Land and Environment Department Manager/Wildlife Biologist and Ronald Schirmer
agreed that removing living vegetation smaller than 3 inches in diameter as well as dead

53
vegetation from the AOI would be acceptable in terms of its environmental impacts (Miller
et al. 2020, conversation via conference call, May 20th). The crew had slight difficulty in
operating equipment initially, but after a few hours assembling the field and brush mower
purchased for the project and struggling to start the ESRL’s ECHO string trimmer, which
are notorious for flooding, equipment issues were resolved and brush clearing was well
underway. The brush clearing crew used a DR field and brush mower, ECHO string
trimmer, Stihl chainsaw, and safety glasses to cut brush and downed logs. Gloves, log
chains, and a motorized cart with 4-wheel drive and a rear box were used to transport brush
and large downed logs out of the AOI. The PIIC Land and Environment Department
allowed the brush and logs to be placed in a pile approximately 200 meters west of the
survey’s AOI, on the western portion of the terrace upon which the Belle Creek Mounds
archeological site rests (Miller et al. 2020, conversation via conference call, May 20th).

clear brush in northern grid portions.
While finishing up clearing vegetation, the ESRL archeological surveying crew determined
viable spots to establish two permanent physical datums to the north and west of the AOI.
The crew planned to establish these datums to setup a Trimble M3 DR 5” total station to
more accurately pinpoint the physical locations of the previously approximated grid portion
corners for use during geophysical data collection. Ronald Schirmer selected a location
approximately 20 meters north of the center of the northern edge of the eventual central
northernmost grid portion, referred to as grid portion 9. The crew chose this location for
Datum 1 because the majority of the previously approximated grid portion corners were
visible through field glasses from there and it fell between the estimated locations of

55
disturbed mounds. The surveying crew loaded a shapefile with the estimated locations of
the disturbed mounds, based on Lewis’ 1885 survey of the then more extant mound group,
onto a Geo7x GNSS receiver for the purpose of avoiding disturbing difficult-to-see mound
remnants with excavation involved in placing permanent datums. The spot for Datum 2
was selected, while accounting for estimations of the locations of disturbed mounds, at a
location roughly 165 meters southwest of Datum 1 near the western edge of the treeless
pasture area. The crew ensured that Datum 1 and Datum 2 were within each other’s
viewshed so that Datum 2 could provide a visible point to back-sight to from Datum 1.
Two points with known geospatial coordinates that are within each other’s viewshed allow
total station operators to setup a total station able to determine its geographical coordinates
and sight’s azimuth. The crew marked spots chosen for datum locations with plastic pin
flags for future reference.
The day following the determination of ideal permanent datum locations, the ESRL
archeological surveying crew excavated shovel tests at the previously selected spots.
Neither of the shovel tests, the shovel test excavated for Datum 1, ST 1, or the shovel test
excavated for Datum 2, ST 2, yielded artifacts. The crew performed bucket augering,
approximately 1 meter below the base of Datum 2’s shovel test, to gain a better
understanding of the site’s deeper soils in the interest of determining the likelihood of
different archeological features, as well as a preliminary interpretation of the area’s soil
genesis. Ronald Schirmer concluded that the soils present near ST 2 were not well-drained
enough to allow Pre-Contact Period peoples to construct effective sub-surface storage or
cache pits in the nearby area.

56
After the crew excavated and formally documented each shovel test, they mixed concrete
powder and water in a wheelbarrow with a shovel to make concrete to dump in the hole
associated with the shovel test. A metal concrete anchor that would later be punched using
a hammer and nail to create a precise stationary point in space that could be used as a datum
point was then placed flush in the center of the still wet concrete pad.

Figure 3-2: Ronald Schirmer putting the finishing touches on Datum 2.
Following the creation of the permanent physical datum points, the field crew needed to
determine the datums’ precise spatial locations. The crew used a Trimble Geo7x GNSS
receiver, with Trimble CenterPoint Real Time eXtended (RTX) Correction Services
activated, linked to a Zephyr 2 RoHS antenna fixed atop a 2.6-meter SECO range pole with
an attached bipod and circular level to collect both datums’ geospatial coordinates. Center
Point RTX functions using real-time satellite measurements, from multiple satellite

57
constellations, received at an international network of tracking stations to account for
satellite clock and orbit position errors (Trimble Navigation Limited 2019:7). RTX uses
algorithmic atmospheric modeling to differentially correct GNSS signals’ atmospheric
error at the location of the receiver to produce viable real-time corrections for GNSS
without the need for a local base station (Chen et al. 2011). The GNSS corrections
generated are available to receivers through an internet connection or through an additional
satellite signal (Chen et al. 2011). In order for the GNSS receiver to use RTX it had to be
linked to a device with access to the internet. Mobile phones with the ability to use their
phone signals to setup wireless internet hotspots were used to connect the Geo7x GNSS
receiver to the internet in the field allowing the GNSS receiver to access correction
information to achieve a high level of geospatial accuracy.
In determining the datums’ precise locations, the field crew lengthened the telescoping
range pole with the antenna affixed to its threaded top and entered the appropriate antenna
height information into the Geo7x GNSS receiver previously attached to the range pole’s
center. The range pole was lengthened to give the antenna better access to unadulterated
GNSS satellite signals. The crew then leveled the range pole after placing its base spike
into the punched point in the center of the previously placed concrete anchor. After this,
the crew operated the GNSS receiver to collect a point through the collection of multiple
points at a one second interval at sub-decimeter accuracy, which the GNSS receiver would
later amalgamate to improve the accuracy of the final single point. The multiple points
collected seemed to average around 7-centimeter accuracy. That the accuracy was slightly
worse than RTX’s advertised 2-centimeter accuracy could be due to the high number of

58
trees surrounding the open area within which the crew established the datums, obstructing
GNSS satellite signals. The GNSS receiver determined Datum 1 to reside at UTM Zone 15
4933987.868 N 523951.332 E at 247.685 meters above mean sea level (MAMSL) and
Datum 2 at UTM Zone 15 4933917.777 N 523803.912 E at 246.08 MAMSL.

geographic coordinates.
With the new datums established, the crew setup the Trimble M3 DR 5” total station to
accurately stake out the 20 x 20-meter grid portions, which included the project area
boundaries. The first step in setting up the total station involved leveling the instrument
directly over Datum 1 to maximize the accuracy of the instrument. The crew extended a
heavy-duty fiberglass tripod to approximately 5 feet in height after unlocking its extendable

59
legs. The three legs were splayed and locked and the tripod’s head was visually leveled
directly over the punched point on Datum 1’s datum spike. Then, the M3 5” total station,
also commonly referred to as the instrument, was centered and fixed to the tripod head with
a screw, permanently attached to the tripod, that could be threaded into the instrument.
Following securing the instrument to the tripod, the person setting up the total station gazed
through the plummet sight and gently lifted and moved two of the tripod legs to center the
sight over the physical datum point. The previous step differs from the setup method
suggested in the total station’s manual, but the author found it incredibly helpful in
positioning the total station directly above a fixed datum point (Trimble Navigation
Limited 2010:27). Though repositioning legs of the total station’s tripod puts the
instrument at greater risk of damage due to droppage, the crew found it necessary for
expediency following difficulty in positioning the total station over a fixed physical datum
point using Trimble’s recommended method.
After initial positioning of the total station above the physical datum point, a bubble level
on the evened-out tribrach, an adjustable component attached to the instrument that allows
the total station to be connected to the tripod head, was used to approximately level the
instrument through making small adjustments to the tripods legs’ length until leveling
centered the bubble level’s bubble. Then, the sharp feet of the tripod were pressed into the
ground and the tribrach bubble level was used to level the instrument again using
adjustments to leg length. Following the second bubble leveling, the operator setting the
instrument up gazed through the plummet sight again, slightly loosened the screw attaching
the instrument to the tripod, and slid the instrument along the tripod’s head until the

60
plummet sight was again centered on the physical datum point. After that, the operator
turned on the instrument and used its onboard digital level, while the screen of the
instrument was centered between two of the tribrach’s leveling screws, to adjust the
tribrach screws to level the instrument with extreme accuracy.
After the crew leveled the instrument, they setup the instrument, entering weather
information procured from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s
National Weather Service’s webpage for nearby Red Wing Airport in order to get an
accurate measurement of local temperature and pressure to allow the instrument to adjust
for atmospheric conditions that can affect the speed and calculated distance of total station
shots. Following setting up the instrument, the crew manually keyed in coordinates of
Datum 1 and Datum 2, putting them into the total station’s digital memory, and then
indicated to the total station where it was positioned in space, at Datum 1. The crew then
used the total station’s prism mode Class 1 laser distance meter to shoot a back-sight to
Datum 2, targeting a prism attached to a leveled range pole, with a bipod, positioned
directly above Datum 2 (Trimble Navigation Limited 2010:8). Before beginning using
range poles in locating and determining geospatial coordinates with the total station, the
crew purchased adapters that made measurement marks on range poles accurate. The marks
are designed to correspond to the center of a range pole affixed prism’s height above the
ground. The previously mentioned back-sight allowed the total station to determine its
azimuth, in simpler terms the direction its pointing, with ~5 second accuracy.

61

Figure 3-4: Luke Burds and Anna Wiitanen-Eggen setup the Trimble M3 DR 5" Total
Station.
An estimation of the instrument’s accuracy can be achieved through the calculation of the
equation ±(10 + 5 parts-per-million (ppm) or 0.000005 * distance in millimeters (D)) mm.
(Trimble Navigation Limited 2010:53). If the equation is solved for a shot of 200 meters,
greater than any shot taken during fieldwork at the Belle Creek Mounds archeological site
in the summer of 2020, the result is 11 mm. Considering that one shot is required for
azimuth orientation and a second is required for the determination of a geospatial point’s
coordinates with the total station, less than ±22 mm. of error would be expected when
shooting or staking out points with the M3 DR 5” using the aforementioned setup for shots
under 200 meters in length. This means that in combination with the ~±7 cm. accurate

62
datum points, shot and staked out points would have ~±9 cm. total potential error in
geospatial accuracy, though the survey crew anticipates the true accuracy of the points to
be higher due to the general likelihood that the amalgamation of hundreds of individually
recorded high-accuracy coordinates used to create each datum point are well within the
area of potential error.
The surveying crew then imported the 18 sets of UTM coordinates corresponding to the
previously created 20 x 20-meter grid corners into the total station from a flash drive. These
coordinates were exported out of ArcMap 10.7 to Microsoft Excel and then saved as a .csv
on the flash drive before being imported into the instrument. The crew then used the total
station’s stake out feature, which uses the instrument’s orientation and Class 1 laser to
determine the range pole’s geospatial position, and a second range pole with a prism and
bipod to locate the grid portion corners in space. Anna Wiitanen-Eggen had the presence
of mind to use pink plastic pin flags to indicate the locations of grid portion corners that
had been formally shot in and orange flags to indicate that their positions had, as yet, only
been roughly approximated using a GNSS receiver during the first day of fieldwork due to
encountered visual obstructions.
Twelve of the eighteen grid portion corners were staked out without physically measuring
off of the range pole or repositioning the total station to make obscured grid portion corners
visible. The crew performed one resection, R1, which involved moving the total station
approximately 14.4 meters south-southwest of Datum 1, where the instrument had
previously been setup, and back-sighting to Datum 1 and Datum 2 from the total station’s
new location to allow the total station to determine its geospatial position and orientation

63
via triangulation. Crew members were able to shoot in three more of the grid portion
corners following the resection because of the different vantage point the resection
provided. The sightlines from the total station to the three remaining, roughly
approximated, grid portion corners continued to be obstructed by tree trunks following the
resection. In the interest of providing the crew more time to collect geophysical data within
the AOI, the three-remaining tree-obstructed grid portion corners were located by
physically measuring off of the range pole with a tape measure. Measuring took place after
the range pole’s position matched either the total station’s provided in/out range pole
repositioning directive or its left/right range pole repositioning directive, associated with
placing the range pole at unestablished grid portion corners’ appropriate azimuth or
distance from the total station. The respective remaining unmatching or unzeroed
repositioning directive was made as close to 0 cm. as the total station’s sight line allowed
for by carefully moving the range pole either left, right, out, or in incrementally. The
individual holding the range pole then secured the pole in place with its bi-pod and
measured from the range pole’s spike in a distance and direction matching the total
station’s unmatching or unzeroed repositioning directive, placing a flag in the ground at
the true physical location of the grid portion corner as determined by the total station.
Following shooting in the grid portion corners, the survey crew used 100-meter long metric
fiberglass tape measures to determine the level of precision with which the total station
was geospatially locating the grid portion corners. The crew found that the sides of all
measured grid portions were within a centimeter of 20 meters in length indicating that the
total station stake out was a success. The crew’s decision to number grid portions from 1

64
to 10 starting in the southwest corner, with 1, moving to the east, with 2, and then to the
portion north of 1, with 3, and east of 3, with 4 and so on, helped crew members keep
communication clear and geophysical data organized (Figure 3-5). In order to collect
geophysical data over a potential highly disturbed mound, to determine whether or not the
potential mound had geophysical signatures similar to other known mounds within the
project’s original AOI, the archeological surveying crew shot in an additional grid portion
to the west of grid portion 9, grid portion 11. The potential highly disturbed mound in grid
portion 11 was not clearly visible on a LiDAR derived hillshade, but there was an
observable change in vegetation corresponding to its location.

65

Figure 3-5: Map of the locations of permanent datums and the geophysics grid with
numbered portions and its survey points.
At the same time as part of the survey crew finished up staking out grid portion corners,
geophysical data collection began. Retired geophysicist Donald Johnson generously
provided training, advice, and equipment to allow for the collection of relative soil
resistance and magnetometry data. Johnson and survey crew member Luke Burds began
geophysical data collection, collecting measurements of relative soil resistance in grid
portion 7. The ESRL possesses a ground penetrating radar system that the crew used on
this project.

66
Non-invasive geophysical methods including relative soil resistance, magnetometry, and
ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were used throughout the study area to attempt to
identify geophysical anomalies present on site. Through analyzing the size, shape, location,
and the relationship geophysical anomalies have with each other and the visible
environment, analyses of the collected data can develop interpretations of what identified
anomalies indicate and the broader implications of those indications.
The preparation for mappable relative soil resistance data collection involved extending
two fiberglass tape measures from the northwest and southwest corners of a grid portion to
its northeast and southeast corners, respectively. Following setting up tapes to run along
the top and bottom of a grid portion, the crew placed stakes in the ground along the
previously mentioned top and bottom tape measures starting at 50 centimeters in two-meter
increments. After the crew placed the stakes, 20-meter-long guide lines, with flagging tape
marking every even meter of their length and red lines marking every odd meter of their
length, were strung across the grid in a north-south direction and held in place by stakes at
matching distances from the starting grid corners with respect to the previously placed tape
measures. This physical visualization of cells within grid portions allowed the crew to
document, relatively quickly and accurately, where a specific relative soil resistance
measurement was recorded.
The soil resistance meter used is a Geoscan Research RM 15 Resistance Meter. This
approximates soil resistance between its mobile electrical probes that are pushed into the
ground ~3–10 centimeters. The Geoscan Research RM 15 Resistance Meter is outfitted
with two fixed mobile probes, spaced approximately 0.5 meters apart, in addition to two

67
supplementary attachable wings that result in the frame having two more mobile electrical
probes, approximately 1 meter apart, making the frame’s base roughly 1 meter in length.
The array used in determining relative soil resistance on site was a twin array. A twin array
utilizes electrical current traveling between one mobile current probe and one stationary
remote current probe providing electrical current for the detection of soil resistance
readings with one potential mobile probe, to measure relative soil resistance at a location
of interest, and one potential remote probe to measure a stationary background reading to
determine and account for changes in background voltage as the mobile probes are moved
around a sampling grid (Geoscan Research 2009:5-9–5-11). The potential probes detect
the amount of remaining voltage of the current emitted from the current probes in the soil
where the potential probes are placed and work together to approximate the electrical
resistance of the arc of soil between the mobile current probe and mobile potential probe
relative to the remote potential probe’s background reading (Geoscan Research 2009:5-9–
5-11). When extra mobile probes are attached to the mobile probe frame, they can be used
to take readings of relative soil resistance at a greater depth. Current cannot run through
two or more pairs of mobile probes simultaneously as this would not allow for soils
electrical resistance at consistently deeper and shallower depths to be sampled. Creating a
wider mobile probe spaced twin array with 1 meter between a current and potential probe
allows for the resistance meter to detect the relative soil resistance at roughly 1 meter in
depth as opposed to roughly 0.5 meters with the original array, which has a mobile probe
spacing of 0.5 meters.

68
The crew placed the remote probes ~20 meters from the nearest boundary of the grid being
sampled so that the remote potential probe’s background reading would not encounter
significant interference (Geoscan Research 2009:5-9). The remote probes were separated
~3 feet during sampling of grids 7 and 5 and at 155 cm. for the other grid portions. The
reason remote probe placement spacing differed between grid portions 7 and 5 and all other
grid portions was due to miscommunication regarding establishment of a standard
separation distance. Fortunately, while attempting to make adjustments to allow for the
successful collection of relative soil resistance readings in higher resistance soils, the crew
observed that slight differences in the spacing distance of the resistance meter’s remote
probes had negligible effects on displayed relative soil resistance readings. The crew set
the RM15 to use an operating frequency of 137 Hz and used an output voltage of 40 V. A
Constant current range of 1 mA was used in grid portions 5–11 and a range of 0.1 mA was
used in grid portions 1–4. The crew switched to using a 0.1 mA range for relative soil
resistance reading collection in the four southernmost grid portions because their sandier
soil was too resistive to allow the RM15 to display a numerical Ohm reading. Instead, the
RM15 displayed a message indicating that its reading was out of range. Changing to a
lower constant current allowed for the RM15 to display a numerical resistance reading in
the soils of the 4 southernmost grid portions.

69

Figure 3-6: Franky Jackson and Anna Wiitanen-Eggen collect relative soil resistance
data as Ronald Schirmer observes.
The archeological surveying crew collected relative soil resistance readings at a 0.5-meter
north-south interval and a 1-meter east-west interval in a boustrophedonic fashion within
each of the 11 grid portions, alternating between moving north and south with the
completion of each data collection transect to make the relative soil resistance survey
quicker. Data collection was greatly facilitated by the previously mentioned fiberglass tape
measures laid out along the north and south grid portion boundaries, as well as the guide
lines, clearly dividing grid portions into many sampling cells. During relative soil
resistance data collection, one person would move the mobile probe frame to a new cell at
the established interval and take a shallow and a deep reading with the resistance meter,

70
telling a second person the readings who recorded them in either a notebook for grid
portions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11 or Google Sheets for grid portions 8, 9, and 10. When
relative soil resistance data collection began crew members wrote readings in a physical
notebook, transferring them from the notebook to Google Sheets to allow for easier data
visualization. After grid portions 5 and 7 were collected, the crew switched to entering the
readings directly into Google Sheets while surveying grid portions 8, 9, and 10. After the
crew determined that entering data directly into Google Sheets slowed down fieldwork and
left no paper hardcopy to refer back to if readings seemed erroneous, the crew reverted
back to the method of data recordation used initially. Having to rely on multiple pieces of
old and heavily used equipment and proprietary software functioning properly to export an
entire day or two’s worth of collected relative soil resistance data made using the RM15’s
automatic data logger too big of a risk because of the possibility of not being able to export,
and effectively losing, collected data. The crew spent much time during ten of the days of
fieldwork collecting relative soil resistance data over all of the 11 grid portions established
on site.
While other crew members were collecting relative soil resistance data, the ESRL’s
Geospatial Data Manager Andrew Brown developed computer code to allow the manually
collected data to be normalized across all grid portions and displayed on ArcMap10.7
digital geospatial mapping software. The reason relative soil resistance data from different
grid portions needed to be normalized was so that resistance readings collected in different
grid portions under different soil moisture conditions using different remote probe
placement locations could be made comparable to one another and seamlessly visualized

71
together. Seamless visualization of relative soil resistance data facilitates more controlled
data interpretation. Brown’s Python code creates points for each relative soil resistance
reading, normalizes data values between adjacent readings in separate grid portions, and
then uses Empirical Bayesian kriging, an interpolation method for generating raster
datasets that produces little error with small sample sizes, to generate rasters effectively
visualizing collected relative soil resistance data, predicting values for the areas between
points within an established AOI (Esri Inc. 2020). Brown’s Python code allows for
collected relative soil resistance data to be processed without the use of Surfer, commonly
used software for processing and visualizing geophysical data.
Following the collection and in-field analysis of some of the initial relative soil resistance
data, Ronald Schirmer, Franky Jackson, and Andrew Brown took ¾-inch soil probes to
attempt to locate and better understand existing geophysical anomalies, including
attempting to infer how the area north of apparent field edge push had been affected
compared to the relatively agriculturally undisturbed area south of the apparent field edge
push. They used an Oakfield soil probe to take 13 soil probes in approximated locations
determined by measuring off of measuring tapes stretched along grid portion borders to
discern their position within the AOI. These soil probe locations were documented with a
GeoXH 6000 Series GNSS receiver, as the crew’s CenterPoint RTX demo had expired.
The GeoXH 6000 Series, linked to a Zephyr 2 RoHS antenna fixed atop a 2.6-meter SECO
range pole with an attached bipod and circular level, was given access to Minnesota’s State
differential correction system MNCORS, via a Wi-Fi hotspot. Access to MNCORS
allowed the device to determine its location with submeter accuracy through using

72
corrective data generated by determining to what degree and direction a nearby GNSS
receiver was inaccurate in determining its location at a geospatially known point in space,
due to common sources of GNSS error.
During the long process of the archeological surveying crew collecting relative soil
resistance data, Luke Burds collected magnetometry data in all ten of the original grid
portions. The bulk of the magnetometry data collection was done in three partial days of
fieldwork by Burds alone. Donald Johnson instructed Burds on using his Geometrics G858
MagMapper Gradiometer, a device with two magnetometers, placed one above the other,
with its console in gradiometer mode so Burds could independently collect data over the
established 20 x 20-meter grid portions. Burds and Johnson set the gradiometer to record
readings every 0.1 second while Burds walked over transects spaced 1 meter apart marked
by moving two stakes along two tapes outstretched on the northern and southern edges of
grid portions. Burds wore clothing and shoes with no metal components during
magnetometry data collection as metal near the gradiometer’s two cesium sensors can
disrupt the sensors’ reading of Earth’s localized magnetic field. The gradiometer subtracts
its top sensor’s reading from its bottom sensor’s reading to derive a measurement referred
to as a vertical gradient, which eliminates the effects of background temporal variations in
earth magnetism from the measurement of magnetic readings associated with specific
sections of the soil matrix in the area being surveyed (Geometrics 2001:20–21; Kvamme
2006:210). Burds walked at an even speed to attempt to allow the collected magnetometry
data to be geospatially accurate. The magnetometer determines where it takes readings
through estimating its geospatial location by recording the time it takes for an equipment

73
operator to walk a full transect and spatially distributes data points along the transect based
on when the points were recorded. The equipment operator indicates on the console when
they start and finish walking a transect by hitting the console’s MARK and END LINE
buttons. All of the magnetometry data were recorded while walking transects in the same
direction within grid portions to ensure that the vertical magnetic gradient would have more
geospatial consistency. The gradiometer stored collected data in its console making the
collection process much quicker than collecting relative soil resistance data on site.

Figure 3-7: Luke Burds collects geophysical data with a Geometrics G858 MagMapper
Gradiometer.
Following magnetometry data collection, while assessing magnetically anomalous areas
Ronald Schirmer located a metal seat belt along the western border of grid portion 1,

74
indicating that it had affected vertical gradient readings in its vicinity (Burds 2021, email
message to author, January 21st). Ronald Schirmer and Luke Burds located a burned area
that included metal fragments on the ground surface in the northwestern part of grid portion
7, explaining an associated large dipole (Burds 2021, email message to author, January
21st). The survey crew found barbed wire and a shotgun shell in the northeastern part of
grid portion 10, which could have contributed additional vertical gradient dipoles in the
northeastern portion of the 2020 fieldwork’s magnetometry results.
Following data collection, Burds and Brown used MagMap2000 software to export the
gradiometer readings collected over the AOI’s grid portions to a spreadsheet. Brown made
alterations to the previously created relative soil resistance visualization code in order to
create raster maps, using Empirical Bayesian kriging to interpolate between readings at
geospatially documented points, to approximate and visualize the geophysical magnetic
signatures associated with the entire grid.
Geomorphologists and earth scientists came out to the Belle Creek Mounds site to bucket
auger to develop a clearer understanding of how the terrace, upon which the Belle Creek
Mounds site resides, formed. These scientists, Dr. Phillip Larson, Dr. Garry Running, Dr.
Douglas Falkner, Dr. Andrew Wickert, and Jabbari Jones, are interested in the genesis of
the Cannon River. Their conclusions, based on topography and soils encountered during
bucket augering, resulted in interpretations related to the terrace’s genesis helpful in
developing more cogent interpretations of geophysical results.

75

Figure 3-8: Geomorphological bucket augering.
The ESRL archeological surveying crew collected ground penetrating radar data during
and following collection of relative soil resistance data. The crew used 100, 200, and 500
MHz antennae to collect data to help develop a greater understanding of what definitively
cultural mound signatures look like in GPR data to help identify potential mounds and
partially destroyed mounds. The 100, 200, and 500 MHz antennae were pulled north to
south across the entire AOI to see transitions in subsurface geomorphology in addition to
determining the depth of the base of the most prominent mound within the AOI. Three
transects were done north to south with each type of antennae and two were done west to
east. One transect was collected over the two mounds in the southern portion of the AOI

76
and one transect over one potential mound and one mapped mound was collected, which
ran through grid portions five and six.
The 500 MHz GPR antennae collected data over parts of seven grid portions within the
AOI. X and Y lines were collected over grid portion 11 and spanning grid portions 1 and
3. Y lines were collected over grid portion 9 and in the western halves of grid portions 5
and 7. Archeological surveying crew members collected 500 MHz GPR at 0.5-meter line
spacing, using the pull speed dependent Dyna Q setting to determine the number of stacks
used in data collection and a GPR velocity of 0.06 m/ns for effective results in wet soil.
Before data collection could start the GPR’s odometer had to be calibrated to ensure that
the GPR equipment was properly documenting where it was recording data within grid
portions, in addition to documenting the location of the first break in the radar waves
emitted by the transmission antenna and detected by the receiving antenna. Following
setup, a crew of two, one person pulling the antennae and the other wearing the digital
video logger (DVL) and tending the cables hooking the antennae to the DVL, collected
GPR data by moving the running equipment over portions of the AOI where GPR data
were desired.

77

Figure 3-9: Luke Burds and Anna Wiitanen-Eggen collect GPR data with a 500 MHz
antenna.
In two of the final four days on site, the crew conducted shovel testing immediately south
of grid portions 1 and 2 to attempt to determine if the probable former site of a Pre-Contact
Era village, which are common inside the arcs of the Red Wing Region’s mound groups,
encroached onto the PIIC’s property (Fleming 2009:20). Shovel testing was also done to
gain a better understanding of the cultural affiliation of the people who likely constructed
the mound group.

78

Figure 3-10: Anna Wiitanen-Eggen and Luke Burds excavate a shovel test.
Due to the thickness of the vegetation south of the area cleared to collect geophysical data
over mounds and areas in between mounds, 100-meter fiber glass tapes were used to lay in
the shovel test grid. The grid began at the bottom of grid portions 1 and 2 and extended
south 20 meters. The archeological surveying crew excavated 45 shovel tests at an interval
of 5 meters from the southwest corner of grid portion 1 moving east 40 meters to the
southeast corner of grid portion 2 and south 20 meters at intervals of 5 meters in columns
starting from each of the initial shovel tests. This created a grid in which there were 9 northsouth columns of 5 shovel tests. These shovel tests were excavated to 30 x 30-centimeter
dimensions laterally and to depths determined on a test-by-test basis based on artifact
presence in previous levels, often to around 40 centimeters below surface (cmbs), typically

79
after a sandy, culturally sterile, glacial outwash associated B horizon was encountered.
Soils were screened through ¼-inch hardwire mesh, onto tarps, to facilitate complete
artifact recovery and backfilling, minimizing the evidence of disturbance.
Following collection, artifacts recovered during shovel testing were washed, organized,
cataloged, and accessioned into the Minnesota State University, Mankato (MSU, Mankato)
Museum of Anthropology’s archeological repository on MSU, Mankato’s campus in
Mankato, Minnesota. The cataloging procedures used followed the format outlined in the
Minnesota Archeological Integrated Database’s (MAID’s) catalog guide. These artifacts
will be held in MSU, Mankato’s Museum of Anthropology’s archeological repository per
PIIC’s existing agreement with the institution to temporarily hold collections for purposes
of analysis and general curation until the tribe requests their return. Artifact analysis
conducted during cataloging involved the use of MSU, Mankato’s lithic comparative
collection in addition to using comparative pottery specimens derived from other
collections held at the repository.
One final task done in the interest of gauging the extent to which trees interfered with
collected geophysical data, which Geospatial Data Manager Andrew Brown suggested,
involved documenting the locations of trees within the AOI. Over the final two days of
fieldwork Alexander Anton worked using the total station’s Class 3R reflector-less direct
ranging function and laser sight, and two temporarily placed datums, TEMP DATUM A
and TEMP DATUM B, established off of Datum 1, to document tree locations. Four
separate resections were done to allow all 248 trees within the AOI to be mapped from five
separate shooting locations. Tree trunks were marked with high visibility paint as soon as

80
a tree had been mapped with the total station to ensure the same trees were not mapped
repeatedly. The approximated sizes of trees were documented as falling within one of three
size classes: small, less than 25 cm. in diameter, medium, 25 to 50 cm. in diameter, and
large, greater than 50 cm. in diameter. The archeological surveying crew generated two
shapefiles from the tree data to be used to aid in geophysical data interpretation, tree points
and tree polygons.
All geophysical and geospatial data will be provided to and made available to the PIIC with
delivery of the Belle Creek Mounds site’s site treatment plan. Physical data collected
during excavation is curated in the Archeology Division of the Minnesota State Mankato,
Museum of Anthropology during analysis and held there under the terms of an ongoing
curation agreement, until such time as requested for return to the PIIC.

Chapter 4 – Results
Geophysical datasets produced by this project are represented by relative soil resistance,
magnetometry, and ground penetrating radar generated rasters, as well as imagery of
ground penetrating radar related profiles. Though these data merely indicate anomalous
areas within the soil matrix, as discussed in a previous chapter, anomalies could be cogently
interpreted as archeological features if they are in a suitable context and there is adequate
supporting evidence (Kvamme 2006:206). Shovel testing produced a small assemblage of
artifacts of precisely-documented 3-dimensional geospatial origin. In the interest of
communicating this project’s results in a comprehensible manner, the geophysical survey
results will be presented in one third of the area of investigation at a time, to allow for
visualization of smaller relative differences within data. Following the presentation of the
geophysical survey results over the entire area of geophysical investigation, shovel testing
results are summarized and interpreted.
Before discussing geophysical results, the mound boundary and shot data used in
approximating the locations of mounds in disturbed areas warrant more explanation.
Polygons were generated from T.H. Lewis’ survey of the Belle Creek Mound’s mound
group that was conducted when, now no longer visibly present, mounds were still
identifiable on the landscape (Lewis 1885:1–3). Lewis used an open traverse method of
surveying to map identified locations of the individual mounds comprising mound groups
in relation to each other during the Northwestern Archaeological Survey. An open traverse
method of surveying links each measurement of directional bearing and distance to the

82
measurement before it with the initial measurement being tied to physical space via
landmarks, which in the Northwestern Archaeological Survey’s case was often a
conveniently located mound identified within a quarter of a quarter section at a specified
township and range (Dobbs 1991:9; Lewis 1885). There is a potential for both systematic
and random error in Lewis’ survey data.
Lewis appears to have used an open surveyor’s compass, canvas tape, and
an engineer’s level [while surveying mound groups]. Conversations with
modern surveyors indicate that the open compass had an accuracy of plus
or minus one degree. Thus, a reading of 37 degrees could in reality, actually
[be recorded as 36, 37, or 38 degrees] … Lewis’ distance measurements can
also contain small errors. Although these potential errors are not necessarily
significant on small groups of mounds, they can create very real problems
as the errors compound over a large area (Dobbs 1991:9).
After redrafting Lewis’ mound map of the Belle Creek Mounds mound group with
polygons and polylines in ArcMap using the original survey data, the general pattern of
mounds was clearly correct, but the fit was not precisely correct based on clearly visible
and identifiable mounds on a LiDAR derived hillshade. Consequently, this process
corroborates that Lewis’ survey contains errors.
The digital mound polygons and survey shot polylines spatially oriented with respect to
each other, created with Lewis’ survey data, have been adjusted to pattered elevational
rises corresponding closely, but not exactly, with the Lewis survey (Figure 4-3). In digital
shapefiles separate from the shapefiles depicting Lewis’ original survey results, polylines
representing survey shots have been adjusted to more accurately represent what their
directions and distances should have been had they been taken with greater accuracy and
polygons representing locations of mounds not visible on the LiDAR derived hillshade

83
have been adjusted to more accurately estimate formerly mapped mound locations, through
moving them with the surveyed mound polygons having visible mound expressions on the
hillshade, from which mound locations without visible expressions were ultimately shot.
Where groups of mounds are present on a highly accurate LiDAR generated hillshade,
those mounds and all of the mounds surveyed later in sequence from mounds visible on
the hillshade had their polygons’ locations adjusted, in a previously alluded to newly
created polygon shapefile in ArcMap, to correspond with the mound locations visible on
the hillshade (Figure 4-3). The survey shot polylines were adjusted in a similar fashion.
Through comparing 40 of the LiDAR hillshade adjusted mounds’ locations to their
corresponding unadjusted locations communicated by Lewis’ survey, differences in Lewis’
shot distances and shot directions between surveyed points and the approximate actual shot
distances and shot directions between surveyed points, usually mound center points, were
calculated. Mean absolute percentage error was calculated to determine the average
percentage of distance error between hillshade related “actual” mound locations and Lewis
survey derived predicted mound locations using the formula:
n
M = (1/n) ∑t=1 abs((At – Ft)/At)
At represents hillshade adjusted distances between surveyed points or actual values and Ft
represents Lewis’ derived distances between surveyed points or forecasted values. The
returned value associated with this process was a 6% error. Degree measurements of the
absolute values of differences between the hillshade related and Lewis associated mound
locations were averaged to determine a mean absolute error for Lewis’ shot azimuths. The
returned value associated with this process was 3.4°. The mean distance of Lewis’ survey

84
shots at Belle Creek Mounds is 22.61 meters. Using these values an approximation of
expected spatial error per shot may be determined for Lewis’ survey at Belle Creek
Mounds:
[0.94x = 22.61] x = 24.05 (the longer of two expected true distance values based on
calculated 6% error). To determine the distance between points in space at different angles
and distances from an origin, representing expected error, two formulas were used
(Guichard 2021:12; Strang and Herman 2021:55).

Figure 4-1: Formula to determine point locations from distance and angle from an origin
point (Strang and Herman 2021:55).

Figure 4-2: Formula to determine distance between points (Guichard 2021:12).
√ ((24.05–22.61)2 + (1.43–0)2) ≈ 2 meters of average spatial error per Lewis survey shot
Error compounds with multiple shots in open surveying.

85
The average shot distance error of 2 meters indicates how much Lewis’ survey shot based
predictions of the location of mound center points and by association mound boundaries
themselves are expected to vary from their approximate actual locations, which implies
that mounds lacking a discernable visible surface expression may deviate slightly from
where Lewis’ survey data suggest they are. Using the previously discussed formulas to
predict expected spatial error for an uncommonly long 100-meter-shot with an average
azimuth error of 3.4° yields an expected spatial error value of 8.84 meters. The maximum
1885 Lewis survey recorded azimuth error of ~13° for a shot of ~17 meters recorded as
15.24 meters, produced a distance difference of 4.3 meters between Lewis and LiDAR
hillshade adjusted mound center points. This 4.3-meter distance difference prevented the
Lewis and the hillshade adjusted mound polygons from overlapping due to the mound
radius’ size being 3.6576 meters, smaller than the distance difference between the
unadjusted Lewis survey and hillshade determined center points. If a mound that another
mound’s location is being predicted off of is in a location unconfirmed via hillshade, then
the mound location that is being predicted is likely to further deviate from its actual
location. With more and more expected deviation from true mound locations in long
sequences of mound locations not visible on the LiDAR derived hillshade, the mound
locations represented in the adjusted polygon layer become less and less reliable in terms
of their ability to accurately represent the former locations of mounds visible on the
landscape.

86

Figure 4-3: Hillshade adjusted mound polygons represented with mound polygons
generated from Lewis' 1885 survey notes anchored at Mound 8.
To attempt to adjust for mound center point location errors in the 1885 survey data where
mounds are no longer visible, a linear regression analysis was performed on the Lewis
survey distance data, using the LiDAR hillshade adjusted mound location data as known
actual values, with Shapiro-Wilk, skewness, and kurtosis tests indicating that the residual
data had a normal distribution (Rogerson 2015). The null hypothesis that the observed
subtracted from the predicted residuals come from a normal distribution could not be
rejected. The distance data’s real minus predicted value’s mean is –6.12843109593e –15,
distribution is approximately symmetric at 0.283619201603, excess kurtosis value is

87
0.417650712365, R2 is 0.990500968463, standard deviation is ±1.42063739255, two
standard deviations from the mean are represented as [2.8412747850975335,
–2.8412747850975211].

Figure 4-4: Lewis distance linear regression line Y_hat = –0.816013963143 +
1.0972812151x represented with points contributing to its creation (numbers indicate
meters with points’ x-values representing Lewis survey shot distances and y-values
representing corresponding hillshade shot distances).
Linear regression did not produce residual data with a normal distribution for shot azimuth
values from the 1885 Lewis survey and the LiDAR hillshade adjusted survey as the data
failed the kurtosis test. The null hypothesis that the observed minus predicted residuals
come from a normal distribution could be rejected. The azimuth data’s mean is
–2.1505011946, standard deviation is ±4.00158711373, distribution is approximately

88
symmetric at 0.27005917329, and excess kurtosis value is 2.01392761903. Due to data
being non-normal, Chebyshev's theorem, which allows for the creation of non-parametric
confidence intervals, was used to infer an upper bound and lower bound for the percentage
of shot azimuth difference data likely to be inside of maximum and minimum observed
values (Shafer and Zhang 2015:36–41).
Chebyshev’s theorem is written as:
k = ((mean + mean_adjusted_interval_value) – (mean – mean_adjusted_interval_value)) /
standard_deviation
The likely percentage of values falling within the interval created using Chebyshev’s
theorem is determined with:
likely_percentage_of_values_in_created_bounds = (1 – (1 / (k * k))) * 100
The lower bound is the determined mean adjusted interval value subtracted from the mean
and the upper bound is the determined mean adjusted interval value added to the mean.
Together these limits create a range or interval.
The range or interval, which bounds sample azimuth values to achieve a confidence
interval above 95%, produced for this project using Chebyshev’s theorem with mound
survey shot azimuth difference data, was (–13.005986213684089, 8.7049838244915065)
and encompasses at least 96.6% of population azimuth values. The values in the determined
range can be subtracted and added, respectively, to unadjusted Lewis survey azimuths to
account for their possible errors with 96.6% certainty.

89
This bound for azimuth values was used in combination with the generated shot distance
related linear regression line and its associated standard deviation values to produce a
geospatial boundary encompassing the area in which a mound center point would fall with
greater than 95% certainty (Figure 4-5). Though this method can produce boundaries that
have a high likelihood of containing mound center points in areas where mound locations
are no longer visibly identifiable, its produced areas become unwieldy when attempting to
predict the location of a mound center point from visually or geospatially unconfirmed
mound center point locations. This is merely a preliminary exploration of a mound center
point location prediction process and the discussed techniques need refinement, but their
discussion establishes useful avenues for future research to promote better preservation of
mound remnants and fewer disturbances of mound related burials.

Geophysics
Relative elevation and soil texture can have significant impacts on the results of
geophysical tests, especially in assessments of soil resistance (Geoscan Research 2009:63; Somers 2006:118). With the potential impact of elevation and soil texture in mind, in
addition to further establishing the locations of the geophysical grid portions where data
were collected, a map is provided for reference (Figure 4-6).

91

Figure 4-6: Locational elevation map of grid portions including soil series boundaries
with soil textures.
In presenting data collected during the aforementioned geophysical survey, grid portions
1, 2, 3, and 4 are covered first. The reasoning behind presenting this southern third of the
geophysical grid initially, has to do with highly visible, previously mapped, mounds
providing information regarding what type of geophysical signature to expect from highly
impacted and previously unidentified mounds. Lewis’ LiDAR hillshade adjusted 1885
survey, depicted in Figure 4-3, indicates that previously disturbed mound locations lacking
an associated elevational physical surface expression are present within this project’s
geophysical grid, north of the linear field edge push that runs northeast near the northern

92
boundary of grid portions 5 and 6 and the southern boundary of grid portion 8 (Lewis
1885:1–3). The field edge push can be seen in Figure 4-6.

Figure 4-7: Selected geophysical results for grid portions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
The geophysical results for grid portions 1, 2, 3, and 4, summarized in Figure 4-7, present
data collected over two documented mound locations with elevational physical surface
expression. One of the most noticeable aspects of the relative soil resistance data related to
grid portions 3 and 4 is the stark contrast in broadly higher relative soil resistance values
in their southern halves and broadly lower values in their northern halves. This dramatic
shift in electrical resistance is likely attributable to a change in soil texture from silt loam

93
to sandy loam. The southern soil series line on Figure 4-6 corresponds with the changes
seen in soil resistance (Soil Survey Staff 2016).
Though the manual for the soil resistance meter used in collecting data on this project
suggests that mounds tend to result in the measurement of electrical resistance highs with
respect to their surroundings, it is apparent here that is not entirely the case (Geoscan
Research 2009:6-3). This may also be explained as resulting from the apparent abrupt
change in soil composition. Due to an accumulation of soil being needed from nearby to
construct mounds and a likely borrow area, represented by an elevational low, immediately
to the north of the mounds, these mounds may be built on sandy loam with a mixture of
silt loam and sandy loam, which would be a less electrically resistive material than the
material that is prevalent in the areas to the west, east, and south of the mounds’ locations.
The mounds are still relative highs in relation the majority of the land in the grid portions
that they occupy, probably partially attributable to their greater elevation and the possibility
of prepared resistive surfaces within the mounds, but the relatively high, in relation the grid
portions as a whole, area between the mounds is still measured as more resistive. A lack of
less resistive material deposited in between the mounds in combination with it being
relatively high in elevation may explain why it is more resistant than the mounds.
Another factor involved in the mounds lack of noticeably high relative electrical resistance
may be the trees growing on each of them. Tree root systems may hold more moisture than
surrounding soils, especially in well-drained courser textured soils, and moisture is
associated with less electrical resistance (Geoscan Research 2009:6-3). In the window
displaying the relative soil resistance raster, trees are depicted as brown specks of different

94
sizes relative to their trunk diameter, small under 25 cm., medium 25 to 50 cm., and large
greater than 50 cm. The two large trees on the western mound, between grid portions 1 and
3, are associated with significant drops in soil resistance. Trees present off of the mounds
appear to be associated with drops in relative soil electrical resistance as well. A small pit
was present at the time of surveying near where the eastern low on the west mound was
measured. The presence of this pit probably resulted in more moisture accumulation and
retention in its location. Going forward, the precedent set by the geophysics collected in
association with these documented, mounds with elevational physical surface expressions
is that mounds on site will be represented as relative resistance highs either exceeding or
comparable to other resistance highs in soils residing in locations beyond purported mound
boundaries.
Through observing the relative earth magnetism detected over the southern grid portions,
it is apparent that the mounds have a stronger magnetic signature than the immediately
adjacent soils. This is in accordance with expectations because of how mounds appear in
previous geophysical mound studies and are described as appearing in theoretical
explanations, potentially due to an accumulation of topsoil (Betts and Stay 2017:48–50;
Kvamme 2006:217–218). An area of low magnetism, similar to what is seen surrounding
both of the mounds, has been documented in a previously cited mound study (Betts and
Stay 2017:49–50). There also appear to be smaller magnetic anomalies present within the
mound boundaries, which might be explained as representative of burned stones,
magnetized through the thermoremanent effect, buried within the mound (Arzigian and
Stevenson 2003:140 and 156–158; Kvamme 2006:207–208). Buried burned stones may be

95
detected as a dipolar field, with paired positive and negative magnetic extremes depicted
within isolated spots (Kvamme et al. 2006:48).
Curiously, seemingly in contrast to the explanations provided in some of the previously
cited sources, the relatively topographically low area to the north of both of the mounds
appears as a magnetically high anomaly like the mounds, with the strongest magnetism
depicted in congruence with the low area’s lowest spot. In making sense of the
magnetically high anomaly in the elevational low, erosional deposition of enriched topsoil
including magnetic materials from accumulated topsoil more easily put in suspension due
to a smaller size and density and moved via splash and sheet erosion may be the reason for
its existence (Kvamme 2006:218–219; Kvamme et al. 2006:48). To conclude magnetic
interpretations, the small dipole to the southwest of the westernmost mound, positioned
along the western boundary of grid portion 1, is associated with the location an old seatbelt
was found in following data collection in the grid portion with the gradiometer.
The results of the ground penetrating radar data collection in grid portions 1 and 3, over
the western mound, are striking. From roughly one to two meters in depth below the ground
surface, the ground penetrating radar detected high amplitude returns in a circular pattern
when viewed in plan. GPR returns are explained as resulting from the contrast in electrical
properties between two materials at their underground interface, the greater the difference
between the materials, the higher the amplitude of the return (Conyers 2006:136). This
explanation of what GPR returns signify suggests that the equipment detected significant
soil contrasts within the mound’s underlying soils (Figure 4-7). According to research
discussed previously, the presence of significant inconsistencies in soil properties within

96
the soil matrix may be the result of the mixing of soils or sediments during the construction
of a mound, possibly through a process referred to as basketloading (Arzigian and
Stevenson 2003:133; Betts and Stay 2017:46). In basketloading, basket loads of earth are
taken from mixed or different strata or borrow area locations and deposited together, often
onto a prepared surface from which the topsoil has been removed in preparation for mound
construction, resulting in a mound having irregular stratigraphy, including lenses of gravel
or subsoil along with other types of material (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:133; Betts and
Stay 2017:46). Basketloading is described as being present within the first mound that
Edward Schmidt excavated at the Belle Creek Mounds mound group, making it all the
more likely that effects of basketloading would be observed in geophysical data collected
over a mound at the same archeological site (Arzigian and Stevenson 2003:133).
The depiction of GPR results, associated with data collected over the western mound, in
profile corroborates the results viewed in plan from 110–112 cmbs. When viewed in
profile, data collected over the mound’s location indicate many curved truncated soil strata
at ~90–140 cmbs with properties that appear to be consistent with the interpretation of
being associated with basketloading-based construction. The mound signatures derived
from these southern grid portions are used in attempting to understand and make sense of
the geophysical results in grid portions 5, 6, 7, and 8 and 11, 9, and 10.

97

Figure 4-8: Selected geophysical results for grid portions 5, 6, 7, and 8.
The geophysical results in grid portions 5, 6, 7, and 8 were collected over: one previously
mapped mound with elevational physical surface expression in grid portion 6, the field
edge push running west-southwest to east-northeast near the northern boundaries of grid
portions 5 and 6 and the southern boundary of grid portion 8, one circular slight elevational
rise not previously mapped as a mound in grid portion 5, and three previously mapped,
impacted mound locations where mounds no longer have elevational physical surface
expressions, in addition to the areas in between the previously stated current, former, and
possible mound locations. The previously mapped mound with elevational physical surface
expression in grid portion 6 has relative soil resistance and earth magnetism readings

98
similar to those of the previously mapped mounds in grids 1, 2, 3, and 4. Relative soil
resistance values are slightly higher than the area’s resistance values outside of the mapped
mound’s boundary. Trees present on the mound could be contributing to the relative
electrical resistance lows within the mound boundary’s western third, as they did on the
mound straddling grid portions 1 and 3. However, it appears that with the soil transitioning
from sandy loam to silt loam with the northward movement out of the southernmost four
grid portions, trees are not as clearly associated with lower values in relative electrical
resistance in soils, with some trees appearing to be associated with relative resistance highs
in grid portions 5, 6, 7, and 8. The recorded earth magnetism is higher within the mound’s
boundary than over adjacent areas. Like the mounds in more southern grid portions
discussed previously, the earth magnetism increase over the mound could be interpreted as
being the result of topsoil accumulation or the creation of a buried burned prepared surface,
although the lack of dipoles indicative of thermoremanent magnetism give more credence
to the former interpretation.
The linear field edge push running through grid portions 5 and 6 near their northern
boundaries and through grid portion 8 along its southern boundary, in its southeastern
corner, provides an interesting test case for how geophysical data are impacted by
elevational rises and topsoil accumulation. The boundary of an apparently cultivated area
associated with the location of the field edge push is present in an aerial image from 1938
indicating that the field edge push was established prior to the aerial photo, possibly in
leveling the area for ease of cultivation (United States Department of Agriculture 1938).
The processes involved in preparing a field for cultivation and cultivation itself appear to

99
have adversely impacted the mounds north of the field edge push, with many no longer
having elevational physical surface expression. The field edge push is easily identifiable in
relative soil resistance data, being represented as a relative high, possibly due to its higher
elevation than immediately adjacent areas, promoting less moisture retention (Geoscan
Research 2009:6-3). The field edge push is represented as a magnetic high much like the
mound in grid portions 1 and 3. The magnetically high signature of the field edge push
may be the result of the accumulation of magnetically rich topsoil much like the magnetic
highs associated with the previously discussed mapped mounds (Betts and Stay 2017:48–
50; Kvamme 2006:217–218). The field edge push’s ground penetrating radar related
signature consists of high amplitude returns indicative of significant soil mixing, similar to
what is seen in the mapped mound in grid portions 1 and 3 (Conyers 2006:136).
Within the southwestern corner of grid portion 5, there is a subtle elevational rise that looks
much like the rises previously mapped as mounds on a LiDAR-based hillshade (Lewis
1885:1–3). This rise has associated with it, highs in relative soil resistance, discussed as
being expected over mounds (Geoscan Research 2009:6-3). The rise is also depicted as
being high in relative earth magnetism, reminiscent of previously mapped mounds and
indicative of magnetite rich topsoil accumulation (Betts and Stay 2017:48–50; Kvamme
2006:217–218). Ground penetrating radar returns from 70–75 cmbs viewed in plan show
high amplitudes associated with the rise, which as mentioned previously could be the result
of mixing due to construction via basketloading, but in any case matches the general
tendency of the ground penetrating radar signature of the mapped mound in grid portions
1 and 3. The GPR data depicted in profile indicates truncated curved stratigraphy from

100
~50–80 cmbs in the area of the elevational rise, encompassed by a green box within a red
box labeled as the eastern edge of the southern geophysically indicated mound location
(Figure 4-8). This elevational rise’s geophysical signature appears to match those of
previously mapped mounds. Although not absolutely conclusive, it is highly likely that this
is in fact an unmapped mound. It is not uncommon for Lewis to have not mapped all
mounds in any specific location. In some nearby instances he simply missed them (see,
e.g., 21GD51), and in other instances he specifically notes that indistinct mounds or
sections of mound groups were not mapped (see, e.g., 21GD45).
The southernmost previously mapped mound location in grid portion 7, depicted in white,
which T.H. Lewis’ 1885 survey, adjusted to a LiDAR-based hillshade, depicts as straddling
the western boundary of grid portion 7, is geophysically supported as being in a slightly
different location to the southeast, depicted in red (Figure 4-8). The reasoning behind the
geophysically indicated mound location differing from the surveyed mound location has to
do with the discussion earlier in this chapter regarding the differences between mound
locations visible on a LiDAR derived hillshade and mound locations determined solely
through the usage of Lewis’ 1885 survey notes, as well as the characteristics of geophysical
data collected over the area. Interestingly, a relative soil electrical resistance high is
depicted in an area slightly lower in elevation than the area around it, in the center of the
geophysically indicated mound location (Figure 4-8). Due to a lower elevation promoting
more moisture accumulation and a lower resistance value, this area is anomalous. This
anomaly might be explained by soils being burned or by soils from other surrounding or
underlying strata being mixed in with topsoils during mound construction, potentially

101
decreasing water retention (Conyers 2012:32–34). The GPR data depicts high amplitude
returns, known to be associated with mounds, both in plan view from 70–75 cmbs and
profile from ~70–90 cmbs, where high amplitude returns are encompassed by a green box
within a red box depicting the northern geophysically indicated mound location in Figure
4-8. The strongest supporting evidence for this being the former location of the previously
discussed surveyed mound is the size and shape of the ground penetrating radar high
amplitude returns matching the circular, highly geometric, dimensions of the Lewis
surveyed mound (Kvamme 2006:222). There are also magnetic dipoles more strongly
associated with the geophysically indicated mound location than with the hillshade
adjusted surveyed mound location (Figure 4-8). These dipoles may be associated with a
hearth or cairn within the mound, as are discussed as being common mound associated
features in the background chapter.
The hillshade adjusted 1885 Lewis survey mound polygon present along the northern
border of grid portion 7 does not appear to be represented by a relative soil resistance high
or any clear ground penetrating radar high amplitude returns. The earth magnetism data
over the surveyed mound polygon are also unhelpful due to the presence of recently
deposited metallic debris found in combination with evidence of a small fire, both of which
contributed to a substantial dipole obscuring subtler magnetism that tends to be associated
with mounds (Kvamme 2006:222). The hillshade adjusted 1885 Lewis survey mound
polygon within grid portion 8 does not seem to have any significant associated relative soil
resistance highs. This location is represented by a magnetic high as known mounds are on
site; however, magnetic data appear to be obscured slightly by linear anomalies that may

102
indicate previous plowing efforts (Kvamme 2006:222). GPR data necessary for generating
a plan view map or digital subsurface profiles were not collected over grid portion 8.

103

Figure 4-9: Selected geophysical results for grid portions 11, 9, and 10.

104
Grid portions 11, 9, and 10 appear to have been disturbed to a greater degree than
geophysical grid portions one through eight to the south, due to their position in long used
artificial pasture (Lewis 1885:1–3; United States Department of Agriculture 1938). Despite
inferred heavier agricultural usage, geophysical data collected over the three northernmost
grid portions supports the presence of mounds. Although the two hillshade adjusted 1885
Lewis survey mound polygons mostly within grid portion 11 do not encompass
geophysical data suggestive of a mound, if both of these polygons are moved south and
slightly east, representative geophysical signatures indicative of mounds of the sizes
specified by Lewis’ 1885 survey exist in relative soil resistance data, relative earth
magnetism data, and GPR returns from 35–40 cmbs, when viewed in plan and profile
(Figure 4-9). These geophysical signatures support the geophysically indicated mound
locations depicted in Figure 4-9 as being the true spatial locations of the previously
surveyed mounds. The linear low in relative soil resistance, relative earth magnetism, and
the amplitude of GPR returns, running to the northeast and southwest across the northern
half of grid portion 11, is representative of a ditch cut that can be clearly seen in Figure
4-6.
Both hillshade adjusted Lewis 1885 survey mound polygons partially present in grid
portion 9 seem to lack clearly associated geophysical anomalies. This may be because of
previous disturbance. There is, however, a curiously shaped anomaly especially visible in
relative earth magnetism data (Figure 4-9). This anomaly appears as a spiral, a very
common decoration on Silvernale pottery representative of the underworld (see Chapter
2). The anomaly’s shape and presence within a burial mound group that functioned as a

105
cemetery, though it cannot be cogently attributed to any earthwork at this point, draws
attention to the potential existence of subtler features that may be present among mound
groups. This anomaly might be associated with intaglio, a three-dimensional reversal of an
effigy mound dug into the ground (Rosebrough 2010:369). In grid portion 10, the hillshade
adjusted 1885 Lewis survey mound polygon that is nearly completely encompassed
appears to have both associated relative soil resistance and relative earth magnetism highs.
These geophysical data support that its current orientation is representative of a true mound
location.
Geophysical indications of mound locations, no longer easily identifiable via changes in
elevation, could contribute to refining understandings related to Lewis’ errors in surveying
as well as the known locations of other, individual, mounds lacking elevational physical
surface expression. Geophysical data provides another means of correcting Lewis survey
data to more accurately determine mound locations and isolate Lewis survey shot errors to
allow for a more accurate interpretation of mound groups as they were when originally
surveyed.
Shovel Testing
Prior to and following the collection of geophysical data, the EARTH Systems Research
Laboratory with the assistance of Franky and Matt Jackson excavated a total of 47 shovel
tests. The initial two shovel tests were excavated in the pasture area, to the north and west
of the area of geophysical investigation, in preparation for the placement of permanent
datums on site. The latter 45 were excavated immediately south of the area of geophysical

106
investigation on Prairie Island Indian Community property. Shovel test excavation took
place to discern which types of artifacts are present on site and in what concentrations.
Shovel testing helped with gaining a better understanding of the archeological cultural
material present on Belle Creek Mounds archeological site and PIIC property that warrants
protection and with the attempted furthering of archeological knowledge of the Red Wing
Region.

Figure 4-10: Gridded shovel testing results immediately south of the geophysics grid.
Of the 47 shovel tests excavated on site, 9 were positive for cultural material. Both shovel
tests excavated in preparation for the placement of Datum 1 and Datum 2 on site were
negative, yielding no artifacts. The artifacts associated with the 9 positive shovel tests

107
consisted of pottery sherds, lithic debitage, and fire-cracked rock, with 5 yielding pottery
sherds, 5 yielding lithic debitage, and 2 yielding fire-cracked rock. In total 7 pottery sherds,
5 pieces of lithic debitage, 65 pieces of charcoal unassociated with any recognized
archeological features, and 2 pieces of fire-cracked rock were collected, cataloged, and
accessioned at the Minnesota State University, Mankato Museum of Anthropology,
Archeology Division’s curation facility. The surveying crew found pottery sherds in each
of the three easternmost positive shovel tests, and shovel test 40 E, –20 N encountered a
buried organically enriched layer that may be part of a feature associated with human
activity during the Pre-Contact Era.
The 45 southern shovel test locations are displayed in Figure 4-10. Some of the locations
had to be slightly repositioned from their initially intended placement, with precise 5-meter
spacing, to allow for the avoidance of obstructions. Empirical Bayesian kriging was used
to generate the raster underlying the depicted shovel test points, approximating the
probability of excavating a positive shovel test in the area encompassed by the shovel
testing grid, based on whether each of the 45 shovel tests in the grid were positive or
negative for artifacts.
Empirical Bayesian kriging differs from other kriging methods by
accounting for the error introduced by estimating the underlying
semivariogram… For each prediction location, the prediction is calculated
using a new semivariogram distribution that is generated by a likelihoodbased sampling of individual semivariograms from the semivariogram
spectrums in the point's neighborhood (Esri Inc. 2016).
All 5 pieces of lithic debitage recovered during sub-surface testing were determined to be
Prairie Du Chien chert with one piece having clear evidence of heat treatment, used in

108
making lithic raw material fracture easily so that it may be more readily knapped and
pressure-flaked into stone tools. Both pieces of fire-cracked rock were classified as granite.
Four of the 7 pottery sherds collected were cataloged as having shell temper with one
having an incised line decoration (Figure 4-11). Shell tempering was indicated by lacunae,
negative space on the surface of pot sherds where shell has since been leeched out of the
pottery (Figure 4-12). One pottery sherd has a cordmarked surface treatment and grit
tempering (Figure 4-13 and Figure 4-14), and two have indeterminate temper and surface
treatment.

Chapter 5 – Discussion and Conclusions
This research supports that geospatial and geophysical methods including relative soil
resistance, magnetometry, and ground penetrating radar can be used to assist in locating
Pre-Contact Native American earthworks and, by association, burials on the Belle Creek
Mounds site and, quite likely, in similar settings throughout the Red Wing Region.
Geophysical methods may also provide inroads toward a clearer understanding of how
mound groups functioned as ritual spaces through the identification of anomalies
potentially representing previously unencountered or overlooked archeological features
that can be further explored using other methods. However, the effectiveness of geophysics
in mound group relocation appear to be contingent on the amount and types of previous
disturbances in an area. For example, the field edge push visible in Figure 4-8 has a
geophysical expression similar to known mounds with the exception of its highly linear
shape.
Because archeological geophysical data interpretation is dependent on the analysis of
relative differences in soil properties across space, the presence of borrow areas used in
mound construction and lack of recent artificial soil build-up, removal, or mixing, facilitate
the interpretation of geophysical surveys over mound groups. If a mound group has fewer
significant modifications since its construction and initial usage in rituals, fewer equifinal
variables need to be taken into serious consideration when interpreting collected
geophysical data. The relative nature of archeological geophysical data collected and

112
interpreted in this project highlights the importance of the negative spaces around mounds
within a mound group in creating recognizable mound related geophysical signatures.
Some of the mounds present in Lewis’ 1885 survey did not seem to have an associated
geophysical signature generated by relative soil resistance, magnetometry, or ground
penetrating radar. These mound locations, lacking elevational physical surface expressions
and a nearby associated geophysical signature, further illustrate the detrimental impact that
ground disturbing activity can have on an archeological site with earthworks. A lack of
Post-Contact Era agricultural practices on site would have likely resulted in identification
of more mound related geophysical signatures in this location. The formerly cultivated area
within the established geophysical grid was the only part of the grid in which geophysical
signatures could not be tied to previously identified mounds.
The use of T. H. Lewis’ 1885 survey proved to be invaluable in geophysical data
interpretation due to its depiction of mound dimensions and their positions in relation to
each other. Without referencing this past survey, it would have been far more difficult to
assess anomalies as evidence of locations of previously visible mounds. One heartening
result of this project is its contribution in beginning to quantify the error present in Lewis’
mound survey data that could allow these 19th century mound surveys to be applied with
greater care in protecting and understanding mound groups. Future geospatial research
contributing to knowledge regarding the sources and types of errors present in these
surveys would likely be of great value in archeological work on formerly mapped mound
groups. Lewis’ survey in combination with other research cited in earlier chapters, may be

113
used to assist in developing boundaries around mound groups accounting for the presence
of mound related activity areas.
Previous research discusses entire mound groups’ sociocultural function as ritual spaces
and cemeteries (see Chapter 2). With disturbances to mound groups, not only are mounds
without elevational physical surface expression, with possible intact underlying burials,
more difficult to identify and more likely to be subjected to further disturbance, the feeling,
otherwise known as the property’s expression of the aesthetic or sense of the time in which
the mounds were constructed, is greatly diminished (U.S. Department of the Interior
National Park Service Cultural Resources Division 2000:36). With a decreased sense of
the time in which mound group construction and rituals initially happened, these places
lose some of their value in providing people, particularly indigenous people, with
opportunities to commune with their past.
The shovel testing conducted south of the geophysical grid yielded a very small number of
artifacts mainly consisting of pottery sherds and lithic debitage. The 5-meter spacing used
for the placement of shovel tests proved to be important in generating a sample of artifacts
useful for archeological interpretation. If a wider shovel test spacing was used immediately
outside of the mound group, preliminary results relating to the Belle Creek Mounds
archeological site’s cultural affiliation would lose significant supporting evidence. The
presence of pottery is generally associated with and supports the interpretation of past
habitation within the arc of mounds present on site, comparable to archeologically similar
settings nearby. The combination of pottery sherds with varied characteristics can be
tentatively interpreted as indicating that the habitation associated with the mound group is

114
an aggregation village due to cordmarked grit-tempered pottery affiliated with Late
Woodland groups being present among smoothed shell-tempered pottery affiliated with
Silvernale and Oneota groups. However, more substantial research needs to be done before
this interpretation can be made with confidence because of the incredibly small size of the
analyzed artifactual collection.
The findings of this project promote the future application of hillshade adjusted Lewis
mound survey results and geophysical methods around and within a generously estimated
mound group boundary prior to development or land usage that may have adverse impacts
on mounds, mound remnants, burials, or other possible mound group features to allow for
their identification to prevent their disturbance or destruction. This recommendation is
made because of the promising results of this Lewis mound survey informed
geoarcheological survey.
