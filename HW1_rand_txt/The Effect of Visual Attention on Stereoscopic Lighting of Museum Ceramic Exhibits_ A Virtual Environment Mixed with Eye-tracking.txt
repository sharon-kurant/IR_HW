Stereoscopic lighting is one of the influencing visual quality factors improving the visual presentation of 
ceramic  exhibits.  However,  the  current  research  only  has  a  specific  definition,  and  there  is  no  clear 
measurement  and  evaluation  method.  This  research  adopted  the  method  of  bidirectional  verification: 
psychophysical experiment and immersive virtual reality (VR) with eye-movement tracking. We proposed 
a  standard  questionnaire  for  the  stereoscopic  visual  experience.  The  eye-tracking  data  show  that  the 
visible  fixation  duration  with  stereoscopic  lighting  is  (M  =  5.18  s),  and  the  number  of  fixation  points 
accounted  for  63.48%  of  the  whole  number.  Both  indexes  were  higher  than  the  situation  without 
stereoscopic lighting. The result shows that the accuracy of finding the detail changes with or without 
stereoscopic  lighting  was  12.5%  through  the  comparison  of  visual  identification  tasks,  and  finding 
modeling changes was 11.5%. In the situation with stereoscopic lighting, the first identification frequency 
increased by 15.9% for small pattern changes of exhibits, as local modeling changes increased by 19%. 
These results indicated that the stereoscopic lighting set according to the exhibits' volume could effectively 
improve the viewer's visual guide, strengthen the visual attention of the details, and model elements of the 
exhibits to achieve the optimal appreciation.

1  Introduction 

1.1  Stereoscopic lighting 
Museum  display 
lighting  requires  excellent  colour 
rendering  performance,  better  presentation  of  the  shape 
and texture of the exhibits, and avoiding glare. The design 
is  divided  into  nine  main directions,  namely uniformity, 
contrast,  visual  adaptation,  apparent  colour,  colour 
three-
rendering, 
dimensionality,  accent  lighting  [1].  These  factors  also 
affect the visual salience and cognitive processing of the 
exhibit during viewing.

The  stereoscopic  lighting  of  modeling  contains  two 
meanings:  one  is  to  show  the  third-dimensional  shape. 
Another is to play a role in highlighting some features or 
shielding local shortcomings according to the exhibition's 
needs. For museum display lighting, the performance of 
the shadow has a pivotal role in the ornamental value. If 
only the directional spotlight was used, the shadows will 
be  too  strong,  making  the  exhibits  too  structured  and 
strengthening  the  exhibits‚Äô  stereoscopic  lighting.  If  we 
only use the floodlight, the dim shadows would make the 

exhibits  comply,  giving  people  relaxation.  Therefore, 
museum  display  lighting  should  make  the  exhibits  have 
proper  stereoscopic  lighting  and  enable  the  details  of 
exhibits to be fully displayed. 

In the China national standard of lighting design [2], 
the  exhibits'  stereoscopic  lighting  should  be  expressed 
through  the  combination  of  directional  lighting  and 
diffused  lighting.  There  is  not  a  clear  indicator  or  even 
definition that how to quantify the stereoscopic lighting of 
exhibits. In Japan, the illuminance ratio is set between 1/3 
and 1/5 for the scope of stereoscopic lighting. Due to the 
diverse modeling of exhibits, it is difficult to specify the 
stereoscopic lighting of all exhibits by only one formula 
and  index  range,  because  the  actual  workload  and  time 
costs are tremendous. Therefore, this study tries to study 
stereoscopic  quantification  for  a  certain  kind  of  exhibit. 
The  results  can be  applied  and  promoted  in  this  kind  of 
exhibit to achieve refining standards. Three formulas were 
used to express the stereoscopic lighting. 

In  this  study,  the  second  formula  was  used  as  a 
reference  index  for  the  museum  showcase's  lighting 
stereoscopic  lighting.  In  the  current  ceramic  exhibition 
area, most light sources use the floodlight and directional 
spotlight  to  gather  light.  Because  of  the  unique  bottom

Cuttle in The UK presented this formula in 1967, and this ratio has been 
proved to play a role in " quantification ". Yun Si and Gongxia Yang (1980) 
[3] also studied the visual environment of museum galleries, and drew the 
conclusion of lighting conditions according to the exhibits with specific 
modeling. It is generally believed that the figure is between in 1.2 and 1.8, 
and the stereoscopic lighting of face is relatively great.

Wenqing zhang (2007) [4] and Zhonglin chen (2009) [5] used this formula 
to study the stereoscopic lighting index of urban lighting, and estimated

irradiate  to  the  exhibits'  shrinking  part.  It  resulted  in  a 
visual effect that the upper part is bright and the lower part 
is  dark,  making  it  impossible  to  see  the  patterns  on  the 
exhibits' side. A formula (ùê∏ùëê ‚àï ùê∏‚Ñé) was used to solve this 
problem  and  obtaining  a  specific  stereoscopic  lighting 
ratio.  According  to  this  ratio,  the  experiment  was 
conducted with different volumes of exhibits. It can help 
designers  obtain  suitable  stereoscopic  lighting  ratio  and 
provide  new

experiments.

1.2  Effects of illumination on visual 

saliency and cognitive processing 
As  people  perceived  objects  and  captured  information, 
visual  attention  focused  on  specific  areas  that  were 
distinctly different from their surroundings in the scanned 
environment. When there was a more salient response to 
these environments, this feature was called visual saliency 
[6]. Specific features - such as brighter object surfaces  - 
tended  to  increase  consistent  visual  behavior  between 
observers  [7].  Features  such  as  brightness,  contrast,  and 
colour  may 
influenced  object  saliency,  attentional 
guidance, and the identification of search cues, and several 
scholars  had  proposed  saliency-based  approaches  to 
modeling attention [8-9]. 

The  non-visual  effects  of  illumination  were  for 
cognitive processing. Studies by Scheer and Buijs confirm 
the arousal effect of illumination brightness on the brain 
[10]. Romine stated that a dynamic light environment with 
high colour temperature and frequency helped to improve 
attention [11]. Jusl√©n et al. found that worker productivity 
increased  significantly  when  higher  colour  temperatures 
were  used  and  that  lighting  also  worked  by  increasing 
visual  sensitivity  [12].  The  effect  of  illumination  on 
memory  was  related  to  task  difficulty,  with  illumination 
levels  having  no  significant  impact  on  more  difficult 
working memory tasks and a significant facilitation effect 
on easier tasks [13-14]. 

contrast  to  enhances  the  viewer's  memory  of  exhibits  is 
important for ceramic exhibits in museum space.  

Firstly, aiming at bottom-up visual saliency, a human 
will  produce  a  conditioned  reflex  for  the  information 
generated  by  objective  objects,  which  is  a  rapid  and 
unconscious stimulus way. By measuring the position of 
the  fixations  or  the  eye-movement  that  is  relative  to  the 
head, a visual influence trend of the exhibit's lighting was 
obtained. Secondly, the conscious attention significance is 
measured with a cognitive experiment, which is a bottom-
up  visual  saliency,  driven  by  Zheng  Peng,  (2004)  [15]. 
Just  and  Carpenter  (1980)  proposed  the  Eye-Mind 
hypothesis that eye-movement provides dynamic tracking 
of  attention  allocation  [16].  In  a  complex  process  of 
information processing, eye-movement and attention are 
inseparable  [17].  In  decades,  the  application  of  eye-
movement  tracking  research  involves  the  direction  of 
information processing, such as reading, scene perception, 
visual search, and so on [18]. At present, few literatures 
have  been  found  in  the  visual  saliency  triggered  by 
stereoscopic lighting of museum exhibits.

stereoscopic lighting of exhibits in VE

In  recent  years,  many  researchers  have  utilized  virtual 
environment  (VE)  to  help  lighting  design.  It  gradually 
becomes one of the academic circles' trends [19]. In the 
traditional  lighting  research,  the  laboratory  scenes  or 
reality were set up to conduct lighting research. To verify 
whether VE can simulate the effects of a real scene and 
the 
the  VE's 
experimental  results,  scholars  have  done  comparative 
experiments.  Chen,  YÔºà2018Ôºâ  [20]  arranged  a  real 
lounge  in  the  laboratory  and  constructed  the  same 
environment 
the  degree  of 
authenticity, he also made video and photo replicas of the 
lounge and asked them to make a subjective evaluation in 
different  environments.  The  result  showed  that  the 
lighting  attributes  were  consistent  with  the  physical 
environment,  and  the  similarity  was  88.6  percent.  Xu

Chao (2018) [21] did a similar psychophysical experiment 
in  the  physical  scene  and  VE,  the  experimental  result 
showed that the participants in these two environments of 
colour temperature preference degree were same. Boyles 
(2009) had ever compared a 2D environment with a  3D 
cave environment. The result showed that 3D's evaluation 
of the subjects is better than the 2D environment [22]. The 
idea  that  VR  was  an  indispensable  technology  for 
designers  to  express  the  lighting  atmosphere  in  the  city 
festival  atmosphere's  lighting  design  was  proposed  by 
Blandet (2011)[23] and Kim (2018)[24]. They  said "VR 
technology can better understand and communicate with 
the projects."  Balocco (2018) [25] set up a museum virtual 
reality  environment  and  conducted 
the 
illumination  and  colour  perception  of  lights.  He  argued 
that conducting the experiment in software not only allows 
for a quick calculation of the energy loss of the light in that 
environment, but also obtained more scientific data such 
as the degree of attraction of the light source to the subject 
by performing statistics on physiological parameters. 

tests  on 

The  subtle  changes  of  various  light  sources  in  the 
museum  can  be  precisely  controlled  in  VR,  which 
balances  the  relationship  between  experimental  control 
and ecological effectiveness. VR reduces the cost of time, 
and has the advantage of persistence. The viewer‚Äôs visual 
behavior  at  the  micro-level  can  be  deeply  analyzed  by 
combining  the  eye-movement  tracking  device  in  VR.  It 
verifies  whether  stereoscopic  lighting  improves  the 
exhibits'  visual  significance  and  proves  that  whether  the 
visual judgment of the viewer is more accurate. 

1.4  Hypotheses 
In this study, the stereoscopic lighting ratios changed in 
response  to  changes  in  lighting  brightness,  allowing  for 
contrast  between  exhibits  and  their  surroundings.  This 
research  focuses  on  the  visual  saliency  and  cognitive 
processing  of  museum's  stereoscopic 
lighting.  The 
specific questions are as follows: 

-Does the visual salience of stereoscopic lighting in a 
museum  space  create  an  effective  guide  to  visual 
attention? 

-Does  the  enhanced  visual  contrast  of  stereoscopic 
lighting  enhance  awareness  and  memory  of  exhibits  in 
other research areas? 

-Can  a  cognitive  questionnaire  be  used  to  measure 
subjects'  perceptions  of 
the  visual  experience  of 
stereoscopic lighting in a virtual reality environment, and 
can a related task be used to measure subjects' cognitive 
efficiency and memory of exhibits? 

In response to the above research questions, and based 
on  the  literature  review,  this  study  proposed  a  series  of 
hypotheses to study of stereoscopic lighting in museums, 
as shown in the table 2. 

2  Method in the first experiment 

2.1  The abstract and quantified exhibit 

model 

The  most  common  exhibits  in  a  museum  with  similar 
modeling  are  selected  as  the  representatives  for  the 
experiment.  According  to  it,  we  researched  stereoscopic 
lighting.  According  to  its  usage,  size,  and  height,  three 
common kinds of maximum cross-sectional area and three 
kinds  of  height  size  were  summarized.  We  got  nine 
different  exhibit  volumes  through  the  cross-sections  of 
these six values, and these nine sizes can match different 
types of exhibits: Chun Ping, Mei Ping, bowl, plate, basin, 
kettle,  pot,  vase.  In  order  to  exclude  the  influence  of 
specific  characteristics  of  exhibits  for  experimental 
results.  We  used  the  way  that  the  3D  primitive  ceramic 
model  was  made  into  experimental  stimulus  material. 
Besides its size, the material, colour etc., all these factors 
are  similar  to  real  ceramic  exhibits.  According  to  the 
characteristics  of  similar  ceramic  exhibits,  we  made  the 
bottom  shrinkage  design  for  its  modeling.  The  size  and 
model corresponding to the category of exhibits are shown 
in the following Figure 2. 

2.2  Modeling and rendering 
In this experiment,  we  mainly used 3Ds max to achieve 
modeling, lighting design, adjusting, and testing. First of 
all,  to  established  space  with  6.0m  long,6.0m  wide,  and 
3.0m  high  as  the  museum's  exhibition  hall.  Uniform 
illumination  is  used  in  the  exhibition  hall.  The  floor 
illumination  is  200  lx,  and  the  uniformity  illumination 
ratio is not less than 0.7. The wall in the exhibition hall is 
covered with 50% medium gray with 0.7 reflection ratio. 
The floor is covered with 80% black with a 0.2 reflection 
ratio  and  lackluster.  The  ceiling  is  covered  with  50% 
medium grey with a 0.7 reflection ratio and lackluster. A 
display  cabinet  with  0.8  m  long,0.8  m  wide,  and  2.2  m 
high is built in the room's center. The top illumination of 
the  display  cabinet  consists  of  directional  lighting  and 
diffuse  lighting.  Moreover,  the  bottom  illumination 
consists of diffuse lighting. The colour temperature of the 
light in the display cabinet is 3300K all the time, the colour 
appearance  features  are  warm,  and  the  colour  rendering 
index  of  the  light  source  is  90.  The  display  cabinet  is 
covered with 70% dark brown with 0.7 reflection ratio and 
lackluster,  and  with  high  transparency  glass  with  0.95 
transmittances. The maximum average illumination of the 
exhibit surface should not exceed 300 lx [26-28]. 

2.3 
Intensity of stereoscopic lighting 
In  this  study,  the  numerical  interval  of  stereoscopic 
lighting was set as 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 2, 3, and 4. We got 
72  pictures  by  adjusting  the  lighting  illumination  and 
in 
rendering.  The  subjects  watched 
sequence  and  answered  the  questionnaire.  The  user's 
stereoscopic evaluation for different volumes of exhibits 
could  be  obtained.  The  specific  stereoscopic  values  and

cross-sectional area and the stereoscopic lighting ratio. The dependent variable is viewer's visual experience. For the 
second experiment: independent variable is the optimal stereoscopic lighting ratio. The dependent variables are the 
visual attention and the cognitive efficiency. The study was divided into two experiments. Experiment one was 
mainly to describe the optimal stereoscopic lighting values of exhibits of different volumes. Experiment two was used 
to compare with the results of experiment one in VR.

participant  age  was  limited  to  a  range  of  18‚Äì28years 
(mean  age:  22.2,  SD  =  2.5  years).  They  all  passed  the 
Ishihara test to ensure that the experiment participants did 
not have colour blindness and colour weakness, and their 
vision or corrected vision was normal. The purposes of the 
study  were  not  disclosed  to  the  participants  prior  to  the 
experiment.  Seventy-two  stimuli  materials  and  80 
participants were divided into four groups, and each group 
tested 20 times. 

Instrument 

2.4.2 
A  31-inch  Dell  LCD  screen  used  to  show  stimulus 
materials, and the brightness and colour temperature of the 
screen  was  adjusted  using  an  illuminometer.  Show  18 
materials in each group by Microsoft PowerPoint. 

2.4.3  Experimental design and procedure 
Participants  were  invited  to  stay  in  a  quiet,  airtight,  and 
dark  space,  and  we  eliminated  the  effect  of  other  light 
sources. The participants sited in front of the screen, and 
then one group of stimulation was shown before them. The 

observation  time  was  7  s  for  each  stimulation.  After 
observing,  the  screen  automatically  turned  to  the  next 
blank  page.  At  the  same  time,  participants  filled  a 
subjective questionnaire. Then they continued to the next 
observation for stimulus by clicking the mouse, repeating 
these procedures until they finish the group‚Äôs 18 stimulus 
materials. The whole experiment lasted about 30 minutes, 
each set of stimuli was played at random. 

2.5  Results and analysis of the first 

experiment 

In  this  experiment,  Likert  scale  was  adopted,  and  the 
subjects were asked to score the key words 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -
2  and  -3  according  to  their  feeling.  The  score  changed 
from 3 to -3 represents the positive to a negative change in 
the word pairs. After the experiment, SPSS software was 
used to analyze the questionnaire data. 

Before data analysis, Œ± reliability coefficient method 
was used to conduct reliability analysis on the scale data. 
The  results  of  reliability  analysis  show  that  Cronbach's 
alpha  is  0.929,  and  the  reliability  coefficient  is  high.

tests, P = 0.000 < 0.05, and there is a correlation between 
the variables, and the factor analysis is effective. 

Principal  component  analysis  was  used  for  the 
questionnaire  data,  and  the  initial  characteristic  value  in 
the  program  was  set  at  1.0.  Every  exhibit  obtained  2-4 
principal  factors,  and  their  cumulative  contribution  rate 
reached  more  than  60%.  SPSS  calculated  the  composite 
factor  scores,  and  the  composite  factor  scores  were 
obtained  when  the  maximum  cross-sectional  area  and 
height were  determined and different stereoscopic ratios 
were obtained. 

3  The second method 

3.1  VR lighting display 
There are two VR scenes were set up in the experiment. In 
the  first  scene,  the  display  cabinets'  exhibits  were  not 
designed  with  stereoscopic 
the 
directional  and  diffuse  lighting  at  the  top  was  used  for 
lighting. In the second scene, exhibits were designed with 
stereoscopic  lighting.    The  optimal  stereoscopic  lighting 
value  was  the  values  which  obtained  in  the  previous 
experiment. To control the variables, the lighting data in 

lighting,  and  only 

the  experiment  was  obtained  through  the  "lighting 
analyses" in the Vray plug-in. After determining the lights' 
illumination level, a 360¬∞ simulated image of 8000*4000 
pixels  were  rendered  by  the  model.  To  simulate  the 
viewpoint of the audience, the camera was rendered at the 
center of the exhibition hall with a height of 1.6 m. The 
experimental errors were all within 5%. The VR setting is 
shown in Figure 3. 

The  final  8  VE  were  obtained,  divided  into  2 
categories according to a stereoscopic lighting design. The 
original  VE  without  stereoscopic  lighting  design  was 
numbered 1-1, while the original scene with stereoscopic 
lighting  design  was  numbered  2-1.  Scenes  without 
stereoscopic  lighting  with  colour,  detail,  and  modeling 
changes were numbered 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 in order, while 
scenes with  stereoscopic lighting design were  numbered 
2-2, 2-3, and 2-4 in order. 

3.2  Procedure 

3.2.1  Participants 
A total of 36 participants (18 women and 18  men) were 
selected to participate in the study, all of whom said they

A. Xiaoqun et al.  

had  not  previously  been  exposed  to  such  study.  The 
participant  age  was  limited  to  a  range  of  18‚Äì25years 
(mean  age:  22.5,  SD  =  1.5  years).  They  all  passed  the 
Ishihara  test  to  ensure  that  the  participants  in  the 
experiment  did  not  have  colour  blindness  and  colour 
weakness, and their vision or corrected vision was normal. 
The  purposes  of  the  study  were  not  disclosed  to  the 

participants  entered  an  eye-tracking  test  environment 
shown in Figure 5. They then were asked to view exhibits 
freely for 20 seconds when we collected eye-tracking data 
simultaneously. 

The second part was a task experiment, in which 18 
participants entered VE 1-1, observed and memorized the 
features of the exhibits, and then randomly switched to one

3.2.2  Equipment 
In this experiment, data including duration of fixation and 
fixation were collected using a virtual reality device, HTC 
Vive Pro Eye, which can track eye movement images and 
immediately  generate  derived  data,  with  a  data  output 
frequency of 120Hz and a precision of 0.5 degrees to 1.1 
degrees. The device used a dual OLED display with a total 
resolution of 2880 √ó 1600 pixels and 615 PPI. The 360 VR 
images  were  programmed  by  Tobii  Pro  Lab  software, 
which  was  used  for  experimental  design  and  eye 
movement data analysis. The brand of the illuminometer 
is  PEAKMETER  and  the  model  is  PM6612L.  The 
illuminometer is calibrated once a year in accordance with 
the code of use to ensure the accuracy in use. 

3.2.3  Experimental design and procedures 
The  first  part  was  eye  movement  experiment,  using  the 
stereoscopic lighting in the display cabinets as a variable 
in the same VE. As Figure 4 showed, the first, third, fifth, 
seventh,  and  ninth  display  cabinets  from  the  left  in  the 
scene had stereoscopic lighting design, while the rest did 
to  compare  whether 
not.  This  was  mainly  used 
stereoscopic  lighting  design  in  the  same  environment 
impacted the visual attention. 

In this experiment, 36 participants were divided into 
two  groups.  After  visual  calibration,  one  group  of 

of  VE  1-2,  1-3,  or  1-4  (1-2,  1-3,  1-4  were  scenes  with 
changes  in  modeling or  colour  or  details  from  1-1),  and 
were asked to find something different from scene 1-1.  

The  experimenter  recorded  the  correct  rate  of  task 
completion  and  task  completion  time.  After  completing 
the  first  difference-finding  task,  the  participants  entered 
VE 2-1, memorized the features of the exhibits, and then 
randomly switched to one of the scenes 2-2, 2-3, or 2-4 in 
the same way (2-2, 2-3, 2-4 were scenes with changes in 
modeling or colour or details from 2-1). The participants 
were asked to find something different from the scene 2-
1.  Participants  would  not  repeat  the  experiment  in  the 
difference-finding  task  between  the  first  time  and  the 
second 
the 
participants found the difference for the first time was 1-
2, and then only scene 2-3 or scene 2-4 would randomly 
appear  in  the  second  time  for  the  difference.  The 
participants  would  not  enter  scene  2-2.  The  other  18 
participants' experiment process was the  same as that of 
the  first  18  participants,  except  that  this  part  of  the 
participants would first enter scene 2-1 to do the different-
finding task and then entered scene 1-1 to do the second

3.3  Data analysis and results 

3.3.1  Duration of fixation analysis 
The  duration  of  fixation  is  the  sum  of  the  time  spent 
observing  an  area,  which  is  an  important  indicator  of 
interest  in  a  particular  area  of  interest.  The  longer  the 
duration of fixation, the higher interest level in a particular 
area of interest. Before analyzing the duration of fixation, 
the  VE  was  divided  into  two  areas  of  interest  based  on 
whether  the  exhibit  was  designed  with  stereoscopic 
lighting, as shown in Figure 5. 

As  Figure  6  showed,  the  duration  of  fixation  in  the 
area of interest with stereoscopic lighting (M = 5.18 s, SD 
=  2.14)  was  significantly  greater  than  that  without 
stereoscopic  lighting  (M  =  2.86  s,  SD  =  1.64).  A  one-
sample  T-test  was  used  to  verify  whether  there  was  a 
significant effect on the duration of fixation. There was an 
outlier in the data of the difference in duration of fixation 
between the two areas of interest, as shown in the Figure 
7.  To  perform  data  transformation,  the  outlier  was 
replaced  with  the  mean  of  the  difference  in  fixation 
duration. The replaced data passed the normality test (p > 
0.05),  as  shown  in  the  Table  7.  Table  8  showed  a 
statistically  significant  difference  in  duration  of  fixation

the black dot in the center of the figure on the left is the position of participants in VR in this experiment, in addition 
to verifying the experience of multiple exhibits with and without stereoscopic lighting design, a task test was 
conducted to determine which factors of exhibit change viewers were more sensitive to. According to the first 
experiment results, exhibit changes were classified into three types of colour, detail, and modeling changes, and 2-3

between the area of interest with and without stereoscopic 
lighting  (p  <  0.05),  indicating  that  stereoscopic  lighting 
had  a  substantial  effect  on  the  participants'  fixation 
duration. 

As  Figure  6  showed,  the  duration  of  fixation  in  the 
area of interest with stereoscopic lighting (M = 5.18 s, SD 
=  2.14)  was  significantly  greater  than  that  without 
stereoscopic  lighting  (M  =  2.86  s,  SD  =  1.64).  A  one-
sample  T-test  was  used  to  verify  whether  there  was  a 
significant effect on the duration of fixation. There was an 
outlier in the data of the difference in duration of fixation 
between the two areas of interest, as shown in the Figure 
7.  To  perform  data  transformation,  the  outlier  was 
replaced  with  the  mean  of  the  difference  in  fixation 
duration. The replaced data passed the normality test (p > 
0.05),  as  shown  in  the  Table  7.  Table  8  showed  a 
statistically  significant  difference  in  duration  of  fixation 
between the area of interest with and without stereoscopic 
lighting  (p  <  0.05),  indicating  that  stereoscopic  lighting 
had  a  substantial  effect  on  the  participants'  fixation 
duration. 

3.3.2  Fixation analysis 
Fixation  refers  to  the  sum  of  the  number  of  all  fixation 
points  in  the  area  of  interest.  It  indicates  the  number  of 
visual stays in the area of interest and is strongly related 
to fixation duration. 

The  results  in  Figure  8  showed  that  fixations  in 
interest areas with stereoscopic lighting (M = 27.33 s, SD 
= 8.35) were significantly greater than fixations in the area 
of interest without stereoscopic lighting (M = 15.72 s, SD 
= 6.35). Fixations with stereoscopic lighting accounted for 
63.48%  of  the  total  fixations,  and  fixations  without 
stereoscopic  lighting  accounted  for  36.52%  of  the  total 
fixations. 

Besides,  a  one-sample  T-test  was  used  to  verify 
whether stereoscopic lighting had a significant impact on 
fixation. The data for the difference in fixations have no 
outliers as shown in Figure 9 and pass the normality test 
(p >  0.05) as shown in Table 9. The results in Table 10 
showed a statistically significant difference in fixation in 
the area of interest with and without stereoscopic lighting 
(P < 0.05), which indicated that stereoscopic lighting had 
a substantial effect on the fixation of participants. 

Figure 5: Segmentation of the scene's area of interest: the yellow area in the figure is the area of interest for exhibits 
with stereoscopic light and the green block is the area of interest for exhibits without stereoscopic light.

In  summary,  these  results  showed  that  the  exhibits 
with stereoscopic lighting attracted more attention, both in 
terms of fixation and fixation duration. Furthermore, the 

participants  were  more  likely  to  pay  attention  to  the 
exhibits  with  stereoscopic  lighting  when  they  were  in  a 
free state.

3.3.3  Task experiment data results 
To analyze which factors of the exhibit were more affected 
by the stereoscopic lighting, three sets of variables in this 
experiment  were  set  up:  changes  in  colour,  detail,  and 

modeling. In the experiment to find different tasks, there 
were  three  sets  of  variables,  two  kinds  of  lighting 
conditions (with or without stereoscopic lighting), and six 
stimulating  VE.  Participants  would  randomly  perform

different tasks in two scenes. Thirty-six participants were 
invited  to  the  experiment  in  which  we  removed  two 
invalid data  and obtained a total of 70 data. The  correct 
rate  of  finding  change  was  counted  and  summarized  in 
Table 11. 

As  shown  from  the  above  table,  the  factor  most 
influenced by stereoscopic lighting was exhibit detail. The 
difference of correct rate between the VR with and without 
stereoscopic  lighting  was  12.5%,  which  meant  that  the 
participants  were  able  to  see  the  details  of  the  exhibits 

better in with stereoscopic lighting, including whether the 
patterns of the exhibits were raised and whether there were 
ice  cracks  and  so  on.  Stereoscopic  lighting  had  the 
secondary impact on the modeling and the least impact on 
the  colour.  For  the  exhibits  with  stereoscopic  optimal 
lighting, the viewer can focus more attention on the details 
of  the  exhibits,  which  improves  the  ability  of  visual 
processing. 

In addition to recording whether the subjects correctly 
found the difference-finding task changes, it also recorded

the variables that were changed for the first time in each 
search process. The frequency table was shown in Table 
12 below. As Table 12 showed, there were three types of 
colour  changes:  similar  colour  changes  and  overall  and 
inverse  colour  changes.  The  presence  of 
partial 
stereoscopic  lighting  has  little  effect  on  the  discovery 
frequency  of  the  three  colour  changes  from  the  results. 
That  is,  the  existence  of  stereoscopic  lighting  has  little 
relationship with the discovery of colour changes, and the 
existence  of  stereoscopic  lighting  will  not  improve 
viewers' attention to the colour of the exhibits. And then 
two types of changes were set up in the detailed task to 
increase or decrease variation in explanation card details 
and  raised  or  flat  decorative  patterns  changes.  From  the 
the  frequency  of  raised  or  flat 
frequency  results, 
decorative  patterns  changes  of 
the  exhibits  with 
stereoscopic  lighting  was  15.9%  higher  than  that  of  the 
the 
exhibits  without  stereoscopic 
exhibits'  raised  or  flat  decorative  pattern  may  cause 
different  visual  effects  due  to  stereoscopic  lighting,  the 
participants  were  more  likely  to  find  out  the  detailed 
changes. Two types of changes were set in the modeling 
task,  partial  or  overall  modeling  changes.  The  result 
showed  that  the  partial  modeling  changes  were  more 
likely  to  attract  attention  after  the  stereoscopic  lighting 
was  optimized,  and  the  frequency  increased  by  19%. 
Partial modeling changes would be more likely to attract 
the participants' attention due to the stereoscopic lighting, 
with  a  19%  increase  in frequency.  This  result  explained 
that raised or flat decorative patterns would cause different 
visual effects due to the stereoscopic lighting. 

lighting.  Because 

This result may explain that raised or flat decorative 
patterns  would  cause  different  visual  effects  due  to  the 
stereoscopic lighting. The participants were more likely to 
find out the detailed changes. Two types of changes were 
set  in  the  modeling  task,  partial  or  overall  modeling 
changes.  The  result  showed  that  the  partial  modeling 
changes  were  more  likely  to  attract  attention  after  the 
stereoscopic  lighting  was  optimized,  and  the  frequency 
increased  by  19%.  Partial  modeling  changes  would  be 
more likely to attract the participants' attention due to the 
stereoscopic lighting, with a 19% increase in frequency. 

lighting  or  not, 

 
Combining the two tables, regardless of whether the 
VR  design  with  stereoscopic 
the 
participants were susceptible to colour changes, and their 
correct rate was high. The frequency of finding the three 
types of colour changes were similar. As for the exhibits' 
modeling and detail, the participants were more likely to 
notice  the  changes  after  the  VE  was  designed  with 
stereoscopic lighting, and the frequency of the first finding 
was also significantly higher. Therefore, for exhibits with 
a  decorative  patterns  or  special  partial  modeling,  more 
attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  design  of  these  exhibits' 
stereoscopic lighting so that participants can more easily 
find their characteristics. 

stereoscopic lighting. The results found that the duration 
of fixation of AOI with stereoscopic lighting was M = 5.18 
s, and the duration of fixation of AOI without stereoscopic 
lighting  was  M  =  2.86  s.  The  fixations  of  AIO  with 
stereoscopic lighting was M = 27.33, and the fixations of 
AIO  without  stereoscopic  lighting  was  M  =  15.72,  the 
fixations of AIO with stereoscopic lighting accounted for 
63.48%  of  the  total  number.  This  result  indicated  that 
exhibits  with  stereoscopic  lighting  could  strengthen 
subjects' visual guidance and enhance the visual quality of 
appreciation. 

In  the  task  comparison  test  of  "finding  different 
changes"  for  visual  identification  in  VR,  there  was  a 
6.25%  difference  in  the  correct  rate  of  colour  change, 
12.5% difference in the correct rate of detail change, and 
11.35% difference in the correct rate of modeling change 
of the utensils with or without stereoscopic lighting. The 
data showed that the design of stereoscopic lighting could 
effectively  improve  the  visual  performance  of  the 
observer.  In  analyzing 
the  detected  changes'  first 
recognition rate, the frequency with stereoscopic lighting 
was  58.8%  for  the  change  in  raised  or  flat  decorative 
patterns  changes,  which  was  15.9%  higher  than  that 
without  stereoscopic  lighting.  For  partial  inverse  colour 
changes,  the  frequency  with  stereoscopic  lighting  was 
37.5%, with a 19% increase in recognition rate than that 
without stereoscopic lighting. This conclusion can guide 
museums  in  optimizing  the  lighting  design  for  more 
detailed patterns and special modeling exhibits. However, 
for the three types of colour changes, only the frequency 
of  partial  inverse  colour  changes  with  stereoscopic 
lighting  (37.5%)  was  slightly  higher  than  the  frequency 
without stereoscopic lighting (33.3%). Comparison of the 
frequency  of  the  other  two  changes  was  lower  than  the 
frequency without stereoscopic lighting. It indicated that 
stereoscopic  lighting  had  little  effect  on  the  visual 
guidance  of  colour  changes.  In  the  top-down  cognitive 
task,  for  detail  and  modeling changes,  the  accuracy  rate 
was  higher  with  stereoscopic  lighting,  verifying  that 
scenes with stereoscopic lighting design were better than 
those  without  stereoscopic 
lighting  design  from  a 
cognitive perspective. 

5  Discussion 
Using immersive VR devices and eye-movement tracking 
technique can enhance the users' sense of immersion and 
providing a unique advantage for exploring people's visual 
attention  [39].  It  can  greatly  stimulate  the  users'  visual 
sense and is used in different fields [40]. In the aspect of 
simulating physical lighting environment, VR is a better 
choice  to  replace  the  physical  scene  and  many  scholars 
have studied the human-factors lighting [41-43]. 

in 

VR  was  applied 

the  research  of  museum 
stereoscopic  lighting,  which  is  not  common  in  the  past 
related research. Using eye-movement tracking technique 
to collect data can measure the salience indexes of human 
vision and improve the authenticity of the data [44]. 

There are some problems deserving discussion in this

The Effect of Visual Attention on Stereoscopic Lighting of ...

The  first  part  of  Experiment  1  was  to  fill  in  the 
subjective  scale  after  watching  the  pictures  on  the 
computer  screen,  and  analyze  the  data  from  the  SD 
semantic scale to explore the influence of the independent 
variables  on  the  comprehensive  factor  scores  of  the 
questionnaire. A participant needed to watch the stimulus 
materials  18  times,  and  the  picture  stimulus  materials 
displayed  on  the  screen  may  cause  the  visual  fatigue 
problem in the observation experience of the participants. 
Using a computer screen to test the visual experience, the 
experiment  needed  to  balance  between  the  minimum 
amount of stimulus materials one participant watched and 
visual fatigue. And then, in the process of data analysis, 
there is no correlation between most independent variables 
and  comprehensive  factor  scores.  For  the  SD  semantic 
scale, the establishment of regression equation may not be 
an appropriate analysis method. 

The classification of the exhibits in Experiment 2 only 
involves  color, detail,  and  modeling.  Further  research  is 
needed  on  the  texture  and  decorative  elements  of  the 
exhibits.  

In previous studies, simulated lighting experiment can 
be performed for a single exhibit by computer, but for a 
large range of space, testing the visual salience of multiple 
exhibits  by  contrast  is  difficult.  Building  a  physical 
laboratory needs to install complex circuit system, it will 
surely consume a lot of resources. However, 3D models 
can  be  changed  and  used  repeatedly  in  VR,  effectively 
saving experimental costs of manpower and material [45-
46]. 

The  difficulty of  this  subject is  how  to  simulate  the 
subtle  changes  of  stereoscopic  lighting  to  the  maximum 
extent and control the complex lighting sources. Choosing 
360¬∞panoramic rendering pictures or interactive 3D space 
in the VR depends on which situation can let experimental 
data  be  more  accurately  tested.  Higuera  et  al,  compared 
the psychological and physiological responses caused by 
two  different  display  forms  (360¬∞  panoramic  rendering 
pictures  and  interactive  space)  of  VR  and  physical 
environment,  finding  that  360¬∞  panoramic  rendering 
pictures had the result that was most similar with physical 
scene [47].  

interference  variables, 

According to the above conclusion, the study adopted 
high-precision 360¬∞ panoramic rendering pictures, which 
can  greatly  reduce  the  risk  of  vertigo  for  participants. 
Using illumination analysis tool like V-Ray Light Meter 
can  precisely  control  lighting  conditions  and  eliminate 
the  control 
other 
accuracy of the experiment [48]. The participants can walk 
and watch freely in the three-dimensional space built by 
Unity3D,  it  is  more  beneficial  to  analyze  participants‚Äô 
behavior in the museum. Improving the authenticity of the 
lighting  environment  and  allowing  participants  to  move 
freely in the VR as in the physical scene still requires new 
auxiliary  tools  or  methods.  Therefore,  it  is  feasible  to 
apply VR in the research of lighting environment [49]. 

improving 

Visual salience is a complex cognitive process, which 
requires comprehensive prediction for multiple evaluation 
results [50]. In VR, some traditional subjective scales and 
task selection questionnaires can be used together except 
for eye-movement tracking measurement. Eye-movement 

tracking can measure recessive visual physiological data, 
subjective  scales  can  evaluate  the  overall  experience  of 
lighting environment and task questionnaires can evaluate 
the  cognitive  behavior  of  participants  [51].  Previous 
studies have shown that there are no differences between 
in  VR  and  traditional  physical  scene  for  the  efficiency, 
satisfaction  and  experience  impression  of  participants 
[52]. 

In  addition,  some  technical  limitations  of  VR  had 
been  found during  the  process  of  experiment.  Firstly,  in 
the  physical  scene,  the  participants  will  automatically 
adjust  the  observation  distance  with  exhibits  due  to  the 
size of exhibits. However, in this experiment, because the 
participants were in the 360¬∞ panorama rendering pictures, 
the environment's center was set as the observation point, 
which was different with the situation that the participants 
in the physical scene. This setting affected the accuracy of 
familiarity  of 
experimental  data.  Secondly, 
participants  with  head-mounted  virtual  reality  should  be 
considered before the experiment. They needed to take 3-
5 minutes for adaptation, which can be gradually reduced 
by practicing [53]. 

the 

Although  VR  has  some  technical  limitations,  at 
present, we believe that the application of VR with eye-
movement tracking and task judgmental testing is a good 
research method for museum lighting research.
